Yet, due to various factors, performance of the rapid acquisition methods usually varies.  Furthermore, in some cases, the RTP receiver can do a simple multicast join (in other cases, it is compelled to do so).  For quality reporting, monitoring, and diagnostic purposes, it is important to collect detailed information from the RTP receivers about their acquisition and presentation experiences.

Media loopback is especially popular in ensuring the quality of transport to the edge of a given VoIP, real-time text, or Video over IP service.  Today, in networks that deliver real-time media, short of running 'ping' and 'traceroute' to the edge, administrators are left without the necessary tools to actively monitor, manage, and diagnose quality issues with their service.

The congestion control algorithm acts as a safety measure by stopping RTP flows from using excessive resources and protecting the network from overload. At the time of this writing, however, while there are several proprietary solutions, there is no standard algorithm for congestion control of interactive RTP flows. This document does not propose a congestion control algorithm. It instead defines a minimal set of RTP circuit breakers: conditions under which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data to protect the network from excessive congestion. It is expected that, in the absence of long-lived excessive congestion, RTP applications running on best-effort IP networks will be able to operate without triggering these circuit breakers.

Negotiating Media Multiplexing Using the

The extension can be used with the SDP offer/answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a single transport (5-tuple) for sending and receiving media described by multiple SDP media descriptions (m= sections). Such transport is referred to as a BUNDLE transport, and the media is referred to as bundled media. The m= sections that use the BUNDLE transport form a BUNDLE group. This specification defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Source Description (SDES) item and a new RTP header extension. This specification updates RFCs 3264, 5888, and 7941."];

Sending Multiple RTP Streams in a Single
RTP Session: Grouping RTP Control
Protocol (RTCP) Reception Statistics and
Other Feedback
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8861.html", target="_top", tooltip="RTP allows multiple RTP streams to be sent in a single session but requires each Synchronization Source (SSRC) to send RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) reception quality reports for every other SSRC visible in the session.  This causes the number of RTCP reception reports to grow with the number of SSRCs, rather than the number of endpoints.  In many cases, most of these RTCP reception reports are unnecessary, since all SSRCs of an endpoint are normally co-located and see the same reception quality.  This memo defines a Reporting Group extension to RTCP to reduce the reporting overhead in such scenarios."];
