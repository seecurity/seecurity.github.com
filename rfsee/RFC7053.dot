SACK-IMMEDIATELY Extension for the
Stream Control Transmission Protocol

It is done by specifying a bit in the DATA chunk header, called the (I)mmediate bit, which can get set by either the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation or the application using an SCTP stack.  Since unknown flags in chunk headers are ignored by SCTP implementations, this extension does not introduce any interoperability problems.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

(SCTP) Stream Reconfiguration
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6525.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many applications that use the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) want the ability to reset a stream.  The intention of resetting a stream is to set the numbering sequence of the stream back to 'zero' with a corresponding notification to the application layer that the reset has been performed.  Applications requiring this feature want it so that they can reuse streams for different purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number so that the application can track the message flows.  Thus, without this feature, a new use of an old stream would result in message numbers greater than expected, unless there is a protocol mechanism to reset the streams back to zero.  This document also includes methods for resetting the transmission sequence numbers, adding additional streams, and resetting all stream sequence numbers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Stream Schedulers and User Message
Interleaving for the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol

This document adds a new chunk to SCTP for carrying payload data. This allows a sender to interleave different user messages that would otherwise result in head-of-line blocking at the sender. The interleaving of user messages is required for WebRTC data channels. Whenever an SCTP sender is allowed to send user data, it may choose from multiple outgoing SCTP streams. Multiple ways for performing this selection, called stream schedulers, are defined in this document. A stream scheduler can choose to either implement, or not implement, user message interleaving."];
