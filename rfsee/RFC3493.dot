Basic Socket Interface Extensions for

But changes are required to the sockets API to support IPv6 and this memo describes these changes.  These include a new socket address structure to carry IPv6 addresses, new address conversion functions, and some new socket options.

Facing robustness requirements, developers are frequently forced to use a stable upper-layer protocol provided by the application itself.
