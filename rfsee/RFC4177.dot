Architectural Approaches to Multi-homing
for IPv6

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a taxonomy for classification of various proposed approaches to multi-homing.  It is also an objective of this exercise to identify common aspects of this domain of study, and also to provide a framework that can allow exploration of some of the further implications of various architectural extensions that are intended to support multi-homing.

Mobility Support in IPv6
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3775.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a protocol which allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Default Address Selection for Internet
Protocol version 6 (IPv6)
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3484.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes two algorithms, for source address selection and for destination address selection.  The algorithms specify default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations.  They do not override choices made by applications or upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the development of more advanced mechanisms for address selection.  The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior.  In dual stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses - depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice-versa.  All IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers, must implement default address selection as defined in this specification. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
