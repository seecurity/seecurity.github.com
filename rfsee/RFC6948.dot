Some Measurements on World IPv6 Day from
an End-User Perspective
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="During World IPv6 Day on June 8, 2011, several key content providers enabled their networks to offer both IPv4 and IPv6 services.  Hundreds of organizations participated in this effort, and in the months and weeks leading up to the event worked hard on preparing their networks to support this event.  The event was largely unnoticed by the general public, which is a good thing since it means that no major problems were detected.  For the Internet, however, there was a major change on a short timescale.  This memo discusses measurements that the authors made from the perspective of an end user with good IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity.  Our measurements include the number of most popular networks providing AAAA records for their service, as well as delay and connection failure statistics."];

Happy Eyeballs: Success with Dual-Stack
Hosts
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6555.html", target="_top", tooltip="When a server's IPv4 path and protocol are working, but the server's IPv6 path and protocol are not working, a dual-stack client application experiences significant connection delay compared to an IPv4-only client.  This is undesirable because it causes the dual- stack client to have a worse user experience.  This document specifies requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and provides an algorithm. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Considerations for Transitioning Content
to IPv6

While this is tailored to address end-user content, which is typically web-based, many aspects of this document may be more broadly applicable to the transition to IPv6 of other applications and services.  This document explores the challenges involved in the transition to IPv6, potential migration tactics, possible migration phases, and other considerations.  The audience for this document is the Internet community generally, particularly IPv6 implementers.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
