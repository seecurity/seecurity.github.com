RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time
Applications
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3550.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

RTP Payload Format for Generic Forward
Error Correction
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5109.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a payload format for generic Forward Error Correction (FEC) for media data encapsulated in RTP.  It is based on the exclusive-or (parity) operation.  The payload format described in this document allows end systems to apply protection using various protection lengths and levels, in addition to using various protection group sizes to adapt to different media and channel characteristics.  It enables complete recovery of the protected packets or partial recovery of the critical parts of the payload depending on the packet loss situation.  This scheme is completely compatible with non-FEC-capable hosts, so the receivers in a multicast group that do not implement FEC can still work by simply ignoring the protection data.  This specification obsoletes RFC 2733 and RFC 3009.  The FEC specified in this document is not backward compatible with RFC 2733 and RFC 3009. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Post-Repair Loss RLE Report Block Type

This report conveys information regarding the individual Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet receipt and loss events experienced during the RTCP interval preceding the transmission of the report.  The new report, which is referred to as the Post-repair Loss RLE report, carries information regarding the packets that remain lost after all loss-repair methods are applied.  By comparing the RTP packet receipts/losses before and after the loss repair is completed, one can determine the effectiveness of the loss- repair methods in an aggregated fashion.  This document also defines the signaling of the Post-repair Loss RLE report in the Session Description Protocol (SDP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Applications may then mix and match to create a set of blocks that cover their set of concerns.

RTP Payload Format for Flexible Forward

These FEC repair packets are sent in a redundancy RTP stream separate from the source RTP stream(s) that carries the source packets.  RTP source packets that were lost in transmission can be reconstructed using the source and repair packets that were received.  The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes that are defined in this specification offer a good protection against random and bursty packet losses, respectively, at a cost of complexity.  The RTP payload formats that are defined in this document address scalability issues experienced with the earlier specifications and offer several improvements.
