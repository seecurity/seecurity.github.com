Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE)
Resource Directory
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9176.html", target="_top", tooltip="In many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, direct discovery of resources is not practical due to sleeping nodes or networks where multicast traffic is inefficient.  These problems can be solved by employing an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which contains information about resources held on other servers, allowing lookups to be performed for those resources.  The input to an RD is composed of links, and the output is composed of links constructed from the information stored in the RD.  This document specifies the web interfaces that an RD supports for web servers to discover the RD and to register, maintain, look up, and remove information on resources.  Furthermore, new target attributes useful in conjunction with an RD are defined."];

It aims to be an alternative to the vCard data format and to be unambiguous, extendable, and simple to process.  In contrast to the JSON-based jCard format, it is not a direct mapping from the vCard data model and expands semantics where appropriate.  Two additional specifications define new vCard elements and how to convert between JSContact and vCard."];
