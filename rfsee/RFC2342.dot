Collected Extensions to IMAP4 ABNF

For ease of reference, this document collects most of such ABNF changes in one place. This document also suggests a set of standard patterns for adding options and extensions to several existing IMAP commands defined in RFC 3501. The patterns provide for compatibility between existing and future extensions. This document updates ABNF in RFCs 2088, 2342, 3501, 3502, and 3516. It also includes part of the errata to RFC 3501.

IMAP4rev2 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes; checking for new messages; removing messages permanently; setting and clearing flags; parsing per RFCs 5322, 2045, and 2231; searching; and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof. Messages in IMAP4rev2 are accessed by the use of numbers. These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers.
