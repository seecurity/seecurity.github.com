Furthermore, it may also be desirable to use different tunnel encapsulation modes between the WTP and the Access Router.  This document defines an extension to the CAPWAP protocol that supports this capability and refers to it as alternate tunnel encapsulation.  The alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint different from the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many known encapsulation types, such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, or CAPWAP.  The WTP may advertise support for alternate tunnel encapsulation during the discovery and join process, and the AC may select one of the supported alternate tunnel encapsulation types while configuring the WTP."];

On-Demand Mobility Management
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8653.html", target="_top", tooltip="Applications differ with respect to whether they need session continuity and/or IP address reachability.  The network providing the same type of service to any mobile host and any application running on the host yields inefficiencies, as described in RFC 7333.  This document defines a new concept of enabling applications to influence the network's mobility services (session continuity and/or IP address reachability) on a per-socket basis, and suggests extensions to the networking stack's API to accommodate this concept."];

Distributed Mobility Anchoring
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8818.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines distributed mobility anchoring in terms of the different configurations and functions to provide IP mobility support.  A network may be configured with distributed mobility anchoring functions for both network-based or host-based mobility support, depending on the network's needs.  In a distributed mobility anchoring environment, multiple anchors are available for mid-session switching of an IP prefix anchor.  To start a new flow or to handle a flow not requiring IP session continuity as a mobile node moves to a new network, the flow can be started or restarted using an IP address configured from the new IP prefix anchored to the new network.  If the flow needs to survive the change of network, there are solutions that can be used to enable IP address mobility.  This document describes different anchoring approaches, depending on the IP mobility needs, and how this IP address mobility is handled by the network."];

Proxy Mobile IPv6 Extensions for
Distributed Mobility Management
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8885.html", target="_top", tooltip="Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow networks to be set up in such a way that traffic is distributed optimally and centrally deployed anchors are not relied upon to provide IP mobility support. There are many different approaches to address Distributed Mobility Management -- for example, extending network-based mobility protocols (like Proxy Mobile IPv6) or client-based mobility protocols (like Mobile IPv6), among others. This document follows the former approach and proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6, in which mobility sessions are anchored at the last IP hop router (called the mobility anchor and access router). The mobility anchor and access router is an enhanced access router that is also able to operate as a local mobility anchor or mobility access gateway on a per-prefix basis. The document focuses on the required extensions to effectively support the simultaneous anchoring several flows at different distributed gateways."];

IPv6 Wireless Access in Vehicular
Environments (IPWAVE): Problem Statement
and Use Cases
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9365.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of IPv6-based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  The main scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications.  First, this document explains use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.  Next, for IPv6-based vehicular networks, it makes a gap analysis of current IPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, mobility management, as well as security and privacy)."];

LDACS is a scheduled and reliable multi-application cellular broadband system with support for IPv6.  It is part of a larger shift of flight guidance communication moving to IP-based communication.  High reliability and availability of IP connectivity over LDACS, as well as security, are therefore essential.  The intent of this document is to introduce LDACS to the IETF community, raise awareness on related activities inside and outside of the IETF, and to seek expertise in shaping the shift of aeronautics to IP."];
