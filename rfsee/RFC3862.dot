Instant Message Disposition Notification

This document provides a mechanism whereby endpoints can request Instant Message Disposition Notifications (IMDN), including delivery, processing, and display notifications, for page-mode instant messages. The Common Presence and Instant Messaging (CPIM) data format specified in RFC 3862 is extended with new header fields that enable endpoints to request IMDNs. A new message format is also defined to convey IMDNs. This document also describes how SIP entities behave using this extension. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A Session Description Protocol (SDP)
Offer/Answer Mechanism to Enable File

SDP is extended to describe the attributes of the files to be transferred.  The offerer can describe either the files it wants to send or the files it would like to receive.  The answerer can either accept or reject the offer separately for each individual file.  The transfer of one or more files is initiated after a successful negotiation.  The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is defined as the default mechanism to actually carry the files between the endpoints.  The conventions on how to use MSRP for file transfer are also provided in this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
