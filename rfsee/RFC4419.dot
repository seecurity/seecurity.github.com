The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol
Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the SSH protocol, as well as the notation and terminology used in SSH protocol documents.  It also discusses the SSH algorithm naming system that allows local extensions.  The SSH protocol consists of three major components: The Transport Layer Protocol provides server authentication, confidentiality, and integrity with perfect forward secrecy.  The User Authentication Protocol authenticates the client to the server.  The Connection Protocol multiplexes the encrypted tunnel into several logical channels.  Details of these protocols are described in separate documents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Additional Diffie-Hellman Groups for Use
with IETF Standards
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5114.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes eight Diffie-Hellman groups that can be used in conjunction with IETF protocols to provide security for Internet communications. The groups allow implementers to use the same groups with a variety of security protocols, e.g., SMIME, Secure SHell (SSH), Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Internet Key Exchange (IKE). All of these groups comply in form and structure with relevant standards from ISO, ANSI, NIST, and the IEEE. These groups are compatible with all IETF standards that make use of Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman cryptography. These groups and the associated test data are defined by NIST on their web site [EX80056A], but have not yet (as of this writing) been published in a formal NIST document. Publication of these groups and associated test data, as well as describing how to use Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman for key agreement in all of the protocols cited below, in one RFC, will facilitate development of interoperable implementations and support the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) validation of implementations that make use of these groups.

Negotiated Finite Field Diffie-Hellman
Ephemeral Parameters for Transport Layer

These shortcomings arise from lack of clarity about which DH group parameters TLS servers should offer and clients should accept. This document offers a solution to these shortcomings for compatible peers by using a section of the TLS Supported Groups Registry (renamed from EC Named Curve Registry by this document) to establish common finite field DH parameters with known structure and a mechanism for peers to negotiate support for these groups. This document updates TLS versions 1.0 (RFC 2246), 1.1 (RFC 4346), and 1.2 (RFC 5246), as well as the TLS Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) extensions (RFC 4492)."];
