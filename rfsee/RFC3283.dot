Its intent is to provide a context for these documents, assist in their understanding, and potentially aid in the design of standards-based calendaring and scheduling systems.  The standards addressed are RFC 2445 (iCalendar), RFC 2446 (iTIP), and RFC 2447 (iMIP).  The work in progress addressed is Calendar Access Protocol (CAP).  This document also describes issues and problems that are not solved by these protocols, and that could be targets for future work.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
