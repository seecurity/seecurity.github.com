A Method for Generating Link-Scoped IPv6
Multicast Addresses
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressing architecture of the IPv6 protocol.  The extension allows the use of Interface Identifiers (IIDs) to allocate multicast addresses.  When a link-local unicast address is configured at each interface of a node, an IID is uniquely determined.  After that, each node can generate its unique multicast addresses automatically without conflicts.  The alternative method for creating link-local multicast addresses proposed in this document is better than known methods like unicast-prefix-based IPv6 multicast addresses.  This memo updates RFC 3306. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
