An Incremental Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN)
for IPv6 Transition
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6264.html", target="_top", tooltip="Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected. As IPv4 address exhaustion approaches, IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues become more critical and less tractable. Host-based transition mechanisms used in dual-stack environments cannot meet all transition requirements. Most end users are not sufficiently expert to configure or maintain host-based transition mechanisms. Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) devices with integrated transition mechanisms can reduce the operational changes required during the IPv4 to IPv6 migration or coexistence period. This document proposes an incremental CGN approach for IPv6 transition. It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6 hosts and IPv4 access services for IPv4 hosts while leaving much of a legacy ISP network unchanged during the initial stage of IPv4 to IPv6 migration. Unlike CGN alone, incremental CGN also supports and encourages smooth transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks. An integrated configurable CGN device and an adaptive home gateway (HG) device are described. Both are reusable during different transition phases, avoiding multiple upgrades. This enables IPv6 migration to be incrementally achieved according to real user requirements.

Such nodes should therefore be able to discover a trusted intermediate router on the link that provides both forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and redirection services to inform the node of an on-link neighbor that is closer to the final destination.  This redirection can provide a useful route optimization, since the triangular path from the ingress link neighbor, to the intermediate router, and finally to the egress link neighbor may be considerably longer than the direct path from ingress to egress.  However, ordinary redirection may lead to operational issues on certain link types and/or in certain deployment scenarios.
