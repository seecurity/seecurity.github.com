MPLS Multicast Encapsulations

The second codepoint (formerly the multicast codepoint) is now to be used only on multiaccess media, and it is to mean the top label of the following label stack is an upstream-assigned label. RFC 3032 does not specify the destination address to be placed in the MAC DA (Medium Access Layer Destination Address) field of an ethernet frame that carries an MPLS multicast packet.

Exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool is a major driver compelling some operators to implement CGN.  Although operators may wish to deploy IPv6 to strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near- term needs may not be satisfied with an IPv6 deployment alone.  This document provides a practical integration model that allows the CGN platform to be integrated into the network, meeting the connectivity needs of the subscriber while being mindful of not disrupting existing services and meeting the technical challenges that CGN brings.

When a multicast data packet enters the domain, the ingress router determines the set of egress routers to which the packet needs to be sent.  The ingress router then encapsulates the packet in a BIER header.  The BIER header contains a bit string in which each bit represents exactly one egress router in the domain; to forward the packet to a given set of egress routers, the bits corresponding to those routers are set in the BIER header.  The details of the encapsulation depend on the type of network used to realize the multicast domain.
