Domain administrators guide
1987", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Domains are administrative entities that provide decentralized management of host naming and addressing.  The domain-naming system is distributed and hierarchical.  This memo describes procedures for registering a domain with the Network Information Center (NIC) of Defense Data Network (DDN), and offers guidelines on the establishment and administration of a domain in accordance with the requirements specified in RFC-920.  It is recommended that the guidelines described in this document be used by domain administrators in the establishment and control of second-level domains.  The role of the domain administrator (DA) is that of coordinator, manager, and technician.  If his domain is established at the second level or lower in the tree, the domain administrator must register by interacting with the management of the domain directly above this."];
