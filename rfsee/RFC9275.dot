An Extension for Application-Layer
Traffic Optimization (ALTO): Path Vector
2022", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol.  It extends the ALTO cost map and ALTO property map services so that an application can decide to which endpoint(s) to connect based not only on numerical/ordinal cost values but also on fine-grained abstract information regarding the paths.  This is useful for applications whose performance is impacted by specific components of a network on the end-to-end paths, e.g., they may infer that several paths share common links and prevent traffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths.  This extension introduces a new abstraction called the Abstract Network Element (ANE) to represent these components and encodes a network path as a vector of ANEs.  Thus, it provides a more complete but still abstract graph representation of the underlying network(s) for informed traffic optimization among endpoints.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
(ALTO) Protocol
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7285.html", target="_top", tooltip="Applications using the Internet already have access to some topology information of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. For example, views to Internet routing tables at Looking Glass servers are available and can be practically downloaded to many network application clients. What is missing is knowledge of the underlying network topologies from the point of view of ISPs. In other words, what an ISP prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it. The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) services defined in this document provide network information (e.g., basic network location structure and preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance. The basic information of ALTO is based on abstract maps of a network. These maps provide a simplified view, yet enough information about a network for applications to effectively utilize them. Additional services are built on top of the maps. This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO services. Although the ALTO services would primarily be provided by ISPs, other entities, such as content service providers, could also provide ALTO services. Applications that could use the ALTO services are those that have a choice to which end points to connect. Examples of such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks."];

Further, these properties are presented as maps, similar to the network and cost maps in the base ALTO Protocol.  While supporting the endpoints and related Endpoint Property Service defined in RFC 7285, the ALTO Protocol is extended in two major directions.  First, from endpoints restricted to IP addresses to entities covering a wider and extensible set of objects; second, from properties for specific endpoints to entire entity property maps.  These extensions introduce additional features that allow entities and property values to be specific to a given information resource.  This is made possible by a generic and flexible design of entity and property types."];

This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced.
