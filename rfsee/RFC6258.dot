Delay-Tolerant Networking Metadata
Extension Block
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines an extension block that may be used with the Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol.  This Metadata Extension Block is designed to carry additional information that DTN nodes can use to make processing decisions regarding bundles, such as deciding whether to store a bundle or determining to which nodes to forward a bundle.  The metadata that is carried in a metadata block must be formatted according to the metadata type that is identified in the block's metadata type field.  One specific metadata type, for carrying URIs as metadata, is defined in this document.  Other metadata types may be defined in separate documents.  This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Delay-Tolerant Networking Architecture
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4838.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant and disruption-tolerant networks, and is an evolution of the architecture originally designed for the Interplanetary Internet, a communication system envisioned to provide Internet-like services across interplanetary distances in support of deep space exploration.  This document describes an architecture that addresses a variety of problems with internetworks having operational and performance characteristics that make conventional (Internet-like) networking approaches either unworkable or impractical.  We define a message- oriented overlay that exists above the transport (or other) layers of the networks it interconnects.  The document presents a motivation for the architecture, an architectural overview, review of state management required for its operation, and a discussion of application design issues.  This document represents the consensus of the IRTF DTN research group and has been widely reviewed by that group.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):
Generic Syntax
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3986.html", target="_top", tooltip="A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.  The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
