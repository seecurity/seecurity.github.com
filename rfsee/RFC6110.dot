Mapping YANG to Document Schema

The mapping takes one or more YANG modules and produces a set of DSDL schemas for a selected target document type -- datastore content, Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) messages, etc.  Procedures for schema-based validation of such documents are also discussed.
