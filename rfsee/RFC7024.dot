Virtual Hub-and-Spoke in BGP/MPLS VPNs
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="With BGP/MPLS Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), providing any-to-any connectivity among sites of a given VPN would require each Provider Edge (PE) router connected to one or more of these sites to hold all the routes of that VPN. The approach described in this document allows the VPN service provider to reduce the number of PE routers that have to maintain all these routes by requiring only a subset of these routers to maintain all these routes. Furthermore, when PE routers use ingress replication to carry the multicast traffic of VPN customers, the approach described in this document may, under certain circumstances, reduce bandwidth inefficiency associated with ingress replication and redistribute the replication load among PE routers.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Data packets are tunneled through the backbone, so that the core routers do not need to know the VPN routes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Wildcards in Multicast VPN Auto-
Discovery Routes
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6625.html", target="_top", tooltip="In Multicast Virtual Private Networks (MVPNs), customer multicast flows are carried in tunnels through a service provider's network.  The base specifications for MVPN define BGP multicast VPN auto-discovery routes and specify how to use an auto-discovery route to advertise the fact that an individual customer multicast flow is being carried in a particular tunnel.  However, those specifications do not provide a way to specify, in a single such route, that multiple customer flows are being carried in a single tunnel.  Those specifications also do not provide a way to advertise that a particular tunnel is to be used by default to carry all customer flows, except in the case where that tunnel is joined by all the provider edge routers of the MVPN.  This document eliminates these restrictions by specifying the use of wildcard elements in the customer flow identifiers.  With wildcard elements, a single auto-discovery route can refer to multiple customer flows or even to all customer flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
