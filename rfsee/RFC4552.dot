Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Extension
of OSPF Using Connected Dominating Set
(CDS) Flooding
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5614.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies an extension of OSPFv3 to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).  The extension, called OSPF-MDR, is designed as a new OSPF interface type for MANETs.  OSPF-MDR is based on the selection of a subset of MANET routers, consisting of MANET Designated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs.  The MDRs form a connected dominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs together form a biconnected CDS for robustness.  This CDS is exploited in two ways.  First, to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedure is used in which only (Backup) MDRs flood new link state advertisements (LSAs) back out the receiving interface; reliable flooding is ensured by retransmitting LSAs along adjacencies.  Second, adjacencies are formed only between (Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors, allowing for much better scaling in dense networks.  The CDS is constructed using 2-hop neighbor information provided in a Hello protocol extension.  The Hello protocol is further optimized by allowing differential Hellos that report only changes in neighbor states.  Options are specified for originating router-LSAs that provide full or partial topology information, allowing overhead to be reduced by advertising less topology information.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Summary of Cryptographic Authentication
Algorithm Implementation Requirements

Recently, effort has been made to add support for the SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) family of hash functions for the purpose of authenticating routing protocol packets for RIP, IS-IS, and OSPF. To encourage interoperability between disparate implementations, it is imperative that we specify the expected minimal set of algorithms, thereby ensuring that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations will have in common. Similarly, RIP for IPv6 (RIPng) and OSPFv3 support IPsec algorithms for authenticating their protocol packets. This document examines the current set of available algorithms, with interoperability and effective cryptographic authentication protection being the principal considerations. Cryptographic authentication of these routing protocols requires the availability of the same algorithms in disparate implementations. It is desirable that newly specified algorithms should be implemented and available in routing protocol implementations because they may be promoted to requirements at some future time.
