IPv6 Enterprise Network Analysis - IP
Layer 3 Focus
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document analyzes the transition to IPv6 in enterprise networks focusing on IP Layer 3.  These networks are characterized as having multiple internal links and one or more router connections to one or more Providers, and as being managed by a network operations entity.  The analysis focuses on a base set of transition notational networks and requirements expanded from a previous document on enterprise scenarios.  Discussion is provided on a focused set of transition analysis required for the enterprise to transition to IPv6, assuming a Dual-IP layer (IPv4 and IPv6) network and node environment within the enterprise.  Then, a set of transition mechanisms are recommended for each notational network.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET)

Enterprise network nodes require a means to automatically provision IP addresses/prefixes and support internetworking operation in a wide variety of use cases including Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) networks, Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), multi-organizational corporate networks and the interdomain core of the global Internet itself.

Routing and Addressing in Networks with
Global Enterprise Recursion (RANGER)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5720.html", target="_top", tooltip="RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing in networks with global enterprise recursion.  The term enterprise network within this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and deployment scenarios, where an enterprise can be as small as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) network, as dynamic as a Mobile Ad Hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational corporation, or as large as the global Internet itself.  Such networks will require an architected solution for the coordination of routing and addressing plans with accommodations for scalability, provider-independence, mobility, multihoming, and security.  These considerations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the same principles apply even for clean-slate approaches.  The RANGER architecture addresses these requirements and provides a comprehensive framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence.

Guidelines for Using IPv6 Transition
Mechanisms during IPv6 Deployment
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6180.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet continues to grow beyond the capabilities of IPv4.  An expansion in the address space is clearly required.  With its increase in the number of available prefixes and addresses in a subnet, and improvements in address management, IPv6 is the only real option on the table.  Yet, IPv6 deployment requires some effort, resources, and expertise.  The availability of many different deployment models is one reason why expertise is required.  This document discusses the IPv6 deployment models and migration tools, and it recommends ones that have been found to work well in operational networks in many common situations.

Operational Guidance for IPv6 Deployment
in IPv4 Sites Using the Intra-Site
Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol

2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6964.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many end-user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly IPv4 internal infrastructures.  These sites range in size from small home/office networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that IPv4 provides satisfactory internal routing and addressing services for most applications.  As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed, however, end-user devices within such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6 functionality.  This document therefore provides operational guidance for deployment of IPv6 within predominantly IPv4 sites using the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)."];
