Report from the IAB Workshop on Stack
Evolution in a Middlebox Internet (SEMI)
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) through its IP Stack Evolution program, the Internet Society, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich hosted the Stack Evolution in a Middlebox Internet (SEMI) workshop in Zurich on 26-27 January 2015 to explore the ability to evolve the transport layer in the presence of middlebox- and interface-related ossification of the stack.  The goal of the workshop was to produce architectural and engineering guidance on future work to break the logjam, focusing on incrementally deployable approaches with clear incentives to deployment both on the endpoints (in new transport layers and applications) as well as on middleboxes (run by network operators).  This document summarizes the contributions to the workshop and provides an overview of the discussion at the workshop, as well as the outcomes and next steps identified by the workshop.

Report from the IAB Workshop on Internet
Technology Adoption and Transition
(ITAT)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7305.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides an overview of a workshop held by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on Internet Technology Adoption and Transition (ITAT). The workshop was hosted by the University of Cambridge on December 4th and 5th of 2013 in Cambridge, UK. The goal of the workshop was to facilitate adoption of Internet protocols, through examination of a variety of economic models, with particular emphasis at the waist of the hourglass (e.g., the middle of the protocol stack). This report summarizes contributions and discussions. As the topics were wide ranging, there is no single set of recommendations for IETF participants to pursue at this time. Instead, in the classic sense of early research, the workshop noted areas that deserve further exploration. Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions."];

What Makes for a Successful Protocol?

Based on case studies, this document attempts to ascertain factors that contribute to or hinder a protocol's success.  It is hoped that these observations can serve as guidance for future protocol work.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Happy Eyeballs: Success with Dual-Stack
Hosts
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6555.html", target="_top", tooltip="When a server's IPv4 path and protocol are working, but the server's IPv6 path and protocol are not working, a dual-stack client application experiences significant connection delay compared to an IPv4-only client.  This is undesirable because it causes the dual- stack client to have a worse user experience.  This document specifies requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and provides an algorithm. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Datagram Transport Layer Security
Version 1.2
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6347.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies version 1.2 of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.  The DTLS protocol provides communications privacy for datagram protocols.  The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.  The DTLS protocol is based on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and provides equivalent security guarantees.  Datagram semantics of the underlying transport are preserved by the DTLS protocol.  This document updates DTLS 1.0 to work with TLS version 1.2. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Limited Domains and Internet Protocols
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8799.html", target="_top", tooltip="There is a noticeable trend towards network behaviors and semantics that are specific to a particular set of requirements applied within a limited region of the Internet. Policies, default parameters, the options supported, the style of network management, and security requirements may vary between such limited regions. This document reviews examples of such limited domains (also known as controlled environments), notes emerging solutions, and includes a related taxonomy. It then briefly discusses the standardization of protocols for limited domains. Finally, it shows the need for a precise definition of limited domain membership and for mechanisms to allow nodes to join a domain securely and to find other members, including boundary nodes. This document is the product of the research of the authors. It has been produced through discussions and consultation within the IETF but is not the product of IETF consensus."];
