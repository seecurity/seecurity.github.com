Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration in IPv6
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4941.html", target="_top", tooltip="Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate addresses using a combination of locally available information and information advertised by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining network prefixes with an interface identifier.  On an interface that contains an embedded IEEE Identifier, the interface identifier is typically derived from it.  On other interface types, the interface identifier is generated through other means, for example, via random number generation.  This document describes an extension to IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration for interfaces whose interface identifier is derived from an IEEE identifier.  Use of the extension causes nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface identifiers that change over time, even in cases where the interface contains an embedded IEEE identifier.  Changing the interface identifier (and the global scope addresses generated from it) over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to identify when different addresses used in different transactions actually correspond to the same node.

Such a design might be inefficient in some scenarios (e.g., use of
multicast in wireless networks) or when nodes are not trustworthy
(e.g., public access networks). These security and operational issues
and the associated mitigation solutions are documented in more than
twenty RFCs. There is a need to track these issues and solutions in a
single document. To that aim, this document summarizes the published ND issues and
then describes how all these issues originate from three causes.
Addressing the issues is made simpler by addressing the causes. This

isolating hosts into different subnets and links can help to address
the three causes. Guidance is provided for selecting a suitable
isolation method to prevent potential ND issues."];
