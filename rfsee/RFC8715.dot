IETF Administrative Support Activity

At the time RFC 8714 was published, the changes to the IETF Administrative Support Activity, Version 2.0 (IASA 2.0) had an impact on the IETF Trust because members of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC), which was being phased out, had served as Trustees of the IETF Trust. This document provides background on the past IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of the rules in the founding documents during the transition to the new arrangement, and provides a rationale for the update."];

That group solicited proposals for the three major IANA functions: names, numbers, and protocol parameters.  This document contains the IETF response to that solicitation for protocol parameters.
