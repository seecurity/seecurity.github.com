Licklider Transmission Protocol -
Motivation
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the motivation for the development of the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) designed to provide retransmission-based reliability over links characterized by extremely long message round-trip times (RTTs) and/or frequent interruptions in connectivity. Since communication across interplanetary space is the most prominent example of this sort of environment, LTP is principally aimed at supporting long-haul reliable transmission in interplanetary space, but it has applications in other environments as well. In an Interplanetary Internet setting deploying the Bundle protocol, LTP is intended to serve as a reliable convergence layer over single-hop deep-space radio frequency (RF) links. LTP does Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) of data transmissions by soliciting selective-acknowledgment reception reports. It is stateful and has no negotiation or handshakes. This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.

Using Self-Delimiting Numeric Values in
Protocols
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6256.html", target="_top", tooltip="Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) have recently been introduced as a field type in proposed Delay-Tolerant Networking protocols.  SDNVs encode an arbitrary-length non-negative integer or arbitrary- length bitstring with minimum overhead.  They are intended to provide protocol flexibility without sacrificing economy and to assist in future-proofing protocols under development.  This document describes formats and algorithms for SDNV encoding and decoding, along with notes on implementation and usage.  This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Datagram Convergence Layers for the
Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant
Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol and
Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7122.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies the preferred method for transporting Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol data over the Internet using datagrams.  It covers convergence layers for the Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050), as well as the transportation of segments using the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) (RFC 5326).  UDP and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) are the candidate datagram protocols discussed.  UDP can only be used on a local network or in cases where the DTN node implements explicit congestion control.  DCCP addresses the congestion control problem, and its use is recommended whenever possible.  This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG) and represents the consensus of the DTNRG."];
