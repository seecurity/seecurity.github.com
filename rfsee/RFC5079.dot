Rejecting Anonymous Requests in the

However, users receiving such calls have the right to reject them because they are anonymous.  SIP has no way to indicate to the caller that the reason for call rejection was that the call was anonymous.  Such an indication is useful to allow the call to be retried without anonymity.  This specification defines a new SIP response code for this purpose. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Multiple Dialog Usages in the Session
Initiation Protocol

Some of these methods can also create a different, but related, association within an existing dialog. These multiple associations, or dialog usages, require carefully coordinated processing as they have independent life-cycles, but share common dialog state. Processing multiple dialog usages correctly is not completely understood. What is understood is difficult to implement. This memo argues that multiple dialog usages should be avoided. It discusses alternatives to their use and clarifies essential behavior for elements that cannot currently avoid them. This is an informative document and makes no normative statements of any kind.

The document defines new SIP URI parameters to exchange PNS information between the UA and the SIP entity that will then request that push notifications be sent to the UA.
