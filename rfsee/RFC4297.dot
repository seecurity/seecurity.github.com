Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over
IP Problem Statement

This document examines this overhead, and addresses an architectural, IP-based copy avoidance solution for its elimination, by enabling Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA).

Marker PDU Aligned Framing for TCP
Specification
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5044.html", target="_top", tooltip="Marker PDU Aligned Framing (MPA) is designed to work as an adaptation layer between TCP and the Direct Data Placement protocol (DDP) as described in RFC 5041.  It preserves the reliable, in-order delivery of TCP, while adding the preservation of higher-level protocol record boundaries that DDP requires.  MPA is fully compliant with applicable TCP RFCs and can be utilized with existing TCP implementations.  MPA also supports integrated implementations that combine TCP, MPA and DDP to reduce buffering requirements in the implementation and improve performance at the system level. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Network File System (NFS) Remote Direct
Memory Access (RDMA) Problem Statement
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5532.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document addresses enabling the use of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) by the Network File System (NFS) protocols.  NFS implementations historically incur significant overhead due to data copies on end-host systems, as well as other processing overhead.  This document explores the potential benefits of RDMA to these implementations and evaluates the reasons why RDMA is especially well-suited to NFS and network file protocols in general.

Internet Small Computer System Interface
(iSCSI) Protocol (Consolidated)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7143.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a transport protocol for SCSI that works on top of TCP. The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with the standardized SCSI Architecture Model (SAM-2). RFC 3720 defined the original iSCSI protocol. RFC 3721 discusses iSCSI naming examples and discovery techniques. Subsequently, RFC 3980 added an additional naming format to the iSCSI protocol. RFC 4850 followed up by adding a new public extension key to iSCSI. RFC 5048 offered a number of clarifications as well as a few improvements and corrections to the original iSCSI protocol. This document obsoletes RFCs 3720, 3980, 4850, and 5048 by consolidating them into a single document and making additional updates to the consolidated specification. This document also updates RFC 3721. The text in this document thus supersedes the text in all the noted RFCs wherever there is a difference in semantics."];
