Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic. They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP. Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion control.

Propagating Explicit Congestion

This specification updates RFC 6040 to clarify that its scope includes tunnels where two IP headers are separated by at least one shim header that is not sufficient on its own for wide-area packet forwarding.  It surveys widely deployed IP tunnelling protocols that use such shim headers and updates the specifications of those that do not mention ECN propagation (including RFCs 2661, 3931, 2784, 4380 and 7450, which specify L2TPv2, L2TPv3, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), Teredo, and Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT), respectively).

(IKEv2) Support for Per-Resource Child

The SA_RESOURCE_INFO notification is used to convey information that the negotiated Child SA and subsequent new Child SAs with the same Traffic Selectors are a logical group of Child SAs where most or all of the Child SAs are bound to a specific resource, such as a specific CPU. The TS_MAX_QUEUE notify conveys that the peer is unwilling to create more additional Child SAs for this particular negotiated Traffic Selector combination. Using multiple Child SAs with the same Traffic Selectors has the benefit that each resource holding the Child SA has its own Sequence Number Counter, ensuring that CPUs don't have to synchronize their cryptographic state or disable their packet replay protection."];

The extension EAP-AKA' Forward Secrecy (EAP-AKA' FS), when negotiated, provides forward secrecy for the session keys generated as a part of the authentication run in EAP-AKA'.  This prevents an attacker who has gained access to the long-term key from obtaining session keys established in the past.  In addition, EAP-AKA' FS mitigates passive attacks (e.g., large-scale pervasive monitoring) against future sessions.  This forces attackers to use active attacks instead."];

Mixing Preshared Keys in the

Exchanges of the Internet Key Exchange
Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) for Post-
Quantum Security
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9867.html", target="_top", tooltip="An Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) extension defined in RFC 8784 allows IPsec traffic to be protected against someone storing VPN communications and decrypting them later, when (and if) a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) is available. The protection is achieved by means of a Post-quantum Preshared Key (PPK) that is mixed into the session keys calculation. However, this protection does not cover an initial IKEv2 Security Association (SA), which might be unacceptable in some scenarios. This specification defines an alternative way to provide protection against quantum computers, which is similar to the solution defined in RFC 8784, but it also protects the initial IKEv2 SA. RFC 8784 assumes that PPKs are static and thus they are only used when an initial IKEv2 SA is created. If a fresh PPK is available before the IKE SA expires, then the only way to use it is to delete the current IKE SA and create a new one from scratch, which is inefficient. This specification defines a way to use PPKs in active IKEv2 SAs for creating additional IPsec SAs and rekey operations."];
