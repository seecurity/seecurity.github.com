Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

TCP is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet.  Over this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion.  This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793.  This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793.  It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements.  It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state.  The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168."];

This memo summarizes the anticipated areas of experimentation and updates RFC 3168 to enable experimentation in these areas.  An Experimental RFC in the IETF document stream is required to take advantage of any of these enabling updates.  In addition, this memo makes related updates to the ECN specifications for RTP in RFC 6679 and for the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) in RFCs 4341, 4342, and 5622.  This memo also records the conclusion of the ECN nonce experiment in RFC 3540 and provides the rationale for reclassification of RFC 3540 from Experimental to Historic; this reclassification enables new experimental use of the ECT(1) codepoint."];
