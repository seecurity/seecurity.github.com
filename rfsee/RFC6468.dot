Sieve Email Filtering: Extension for
Notifications
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5435.html", target="_top", tooltip="Users go to great lengths to be notified as quickly as possible that they have received new mail.  Most of these methods involve polling to check for new messages periodically.  A push method handled by the final delivery agent gives users quicker notifications and saves server resources.  This document does not specify the notification method, but it is expected that using existing instant messaging infrastructure such as Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), or Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) Short Message Service (SMS) messages will be popular.  This document describes an extension to the Sieve mail filtering language that allows users to give specific rules for how and when notifications should be sent. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Sieve: An Email Filtering Language
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5228.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a language for filtering email messages at time of final delivery.  It is designed to be implementable on either a mail client or mail server.  It is meant to be extensible, simple, and independent of access protocol, mail architecture, and operating system.  It is suitable for running on a mail server where users may not be allowed to execute arbitrary programs, such as on black box Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) servers, as the base language has no variables, loops, or ability to shell out to external programs.

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Extension for Instant Messaging
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3428.html", target="_top", tooltip="Instant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer of messages between users in near real-time.  These messages are usually, but not required to be, short.  IMs are often used in a conversational mode, that is, the transfer of messages back and forth is fast enough for participants to maintain an interactive conversation.  This document proposes the MESSAGE method, an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that allows the transfer of Instant Messages.  Since the MESSAGE request is an extension to SIP, it inherits all the request routing and security features of that protocol.  MESSAGE requests carry the content in the form of MIME body parts.  MESSAGE requests do not themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal usage each Instant Message stands alone, much like pager messages.  MESSAGE requests may be sent in the context of a dialog initiated by some other SIP request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A Presence Event Package for the Session

Presence is defined as the willingness and ability of a user to communicate with other users on the network.  Historically, presence has been limited to on-line and off-line indicators; the notion of presence here is broader.  Subscriptions and notifications of presence are supported by defining an event package within the general SIP event notification framework.  This protocol is also compliant with the Common Presence Profile (CPP) framework. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8, the object of this memo.  UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values.
