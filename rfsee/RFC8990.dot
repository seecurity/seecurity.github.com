Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks.  Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included.  Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well."];

Constrained Join Protocol (CoJP) for
6TiSCH
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9031.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the minimal framework required for a new device, called a pledge, to securely join a 6TiSCH (IPv6 over the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping mode of IEEE 802.15.4) network.  The framework requires that the pledge and the JRC (Join Registrar/Coordinator, a central entity), share a symmetric key.  How this key is provisioned is out of scope of this document.  Through a single CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) request-response exchange secured by OSCORE (Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments), the pledge requests admission into the network, and the JRC configures it with link-layer keying material and other parameters.  The JRC may at any time update the parameters through another request-response exchange secured by OSCORE.  This specification defines the Constrained Join Protocol and its CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) data structures, and it describes how to configure the rest of the 6TiSCH communication stack for this join process to occur in a secure manner.  Additional security mechanisms may be added on top of this minimal framework."];

Guidelines for Autonomic Service Agents

Autonomic Service Agents, together with the Autonomic Network Infrastructure, the Autonomic Control Plane, and the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol, constitute base elements of an autonomic networking ecosystem."];

Delay-Tolerant Networking Management
Architecture (DTNMA)
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9675.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) architecture describes a type of challenged network in which communications may be significantly affected by long signal propagation delays, frequent link disruptions, or both. The unique characteristics of this environment require a unique approach to network management that supports asynchronous transport, autonomous local control, and a small footprint (in both resources and dependencies) so as to deploy on constrained devices. This document describes a DTN Management Architecture (DTNMA) suitable for managing devices in any challenged environment but, in particular, those communicating using the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP). Operating over BP requires an architecture that neither presumes synchronized transport behavior nor relies on query-response mechanisms. Implementations compliant with this DTNMA should expect to successfully operate in extremely challenging conditions, such as over unidirectional links and other places where BP is the preferred transport."];
