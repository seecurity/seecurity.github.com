Internet of Things (IoT) Edge Challenges
and Functions
2024", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications have requirements that cannot be satisfied by centralized cloud-based systems (i.e., cloud computing).  These include time sensitivity, data volume, connectivity cost, operation in the face of intermittent services, privacy, and security.  As a result, IoT is driving the Internet toward edge computing.  This document outlines the requirements of the emerging IoT edge and its challenges.  It presents a general model and major components of the IoT edge to provide a common basis for future discussions in the Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG) and other IRTF and IETF groups.  This document is a product of the IRTF T2TRG.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Deterministic Networking Use Cases
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8578.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents use cases for diverse industries that have in common a need for deterministic flows. Deterministic in this context means that such flows provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded latency, and other properties germane to the transport of time-sensitive data.  These use cases differ notably in their network topologies and specific desired behavior, providing as a group broad industry context for Deterministic Networking (DetNet).  For each use case, this document will identify the use case, identify representative solutions used today, and describe potential improvements that DetNet can enable."];

The Constrained Application Protocol
(CoAP)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7252.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks. The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation. CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments."];

Guidelines for the Use of the OAM
Acronym in the IETF
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6291.html", target="_top", tooltip="At first glance, the acronym OAM seems to be well-known and well-understood. Looking at the acronym a bit more closely reveals a set of recurring problems that are revisited time and again. This document provides a definition of the acronym OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) for use in all future IETF documents that refer to OAM. There are other definitions and acronyms that will be discussed while exploring the definition of the constituent parts of the OAM term. This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice."];

Group Communication for the Constrained
Application Protocol (CoAP)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7390.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for constrained devices and constrained networks.  It is anticipated that constrained devices will often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building automation scenario, all lights in a given room may need to be switched on/off as a group).  This specification defines how CoAP should be used in a group communication context.  An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed based on existing CoAP functionality as well as new features introduced in this specification.  Also, various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate important concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for deployment in various network topologies."];
