Delay-Tolerant Networking Previous-Hop
Insertion Block
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines an extension block for use with the Delay- Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol.  This Previous-Hop Insertion Block (PHIB) extension block is designed to be inserted by a forwarding node to provide the endpoint identifier (EID) of an endpoint of which the forwarding node is a member so that this EID may be conveyed to the next-hop receiving node.  Knowledge of an EID of an endpoint of which a previous-hop node is a member may be required in some circumstances to support certain routing protocols (e.g., flood routing).  If this EID cannot be provided by the convergence layer or other means, the PHIB defines the mechanism whereby the EID can be provided with the bundle.  Each PHIB is always removed from the bundle by the receiving node so that its presence within the bundle is limited to exactly one hop.  This document defines the format and processing of this PHIB.  This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Delay-Tolerant Networking Architecture
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4838.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant and disruption-tolerant networks, and is an evolution of the architecture originally designed for the Interplanetary Internet, a communication system envisioned to provide Internet-like services across interplanetary distances in support of deep space exploration.  This document describes an architecture that addresses a variety of problems with internetworks having operational and performance characteristics that make conventional (Internet-like) networking approaches either unworkable or impractical.  We define a message- oriented overlay that exists above the transport (or other) layers of the networks it interconnects.  The document presents a motivation for the architecture, an architectural overview, review of state management required for its operation, and a discussion of application design issues.  This document represents the consensus of the IRTF DTN research group and has been widely reviewed by that group.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
