Definitions of Managed Objects for

In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that allow monitoring of running instances of RObust Header Compression (ROHC).  The managed objects defined in this memo are grouped into three MIB modules.  The ROHC-MIB module defines managed objects shared by all ROHC profiles, the ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module defines managed objects specific to the ROHC uncompressed profile, the ROHC-RTP-MIB module defines managed objects specific to the ROHC RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) profile, the ROHC UDP (User Datagram Protocol) profile, the ROHC ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) profile, and the ROHC LLA (Link Layer Assisted) profile.

Introduction and Applicability
Statements for Internet-Standard
Management Framework

This Framework is derived from and builds upon both the original Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv1) and the second Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv2).  The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the Framework over time.  The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.  The document also recommends that RFCs 1157, 1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic status.  This document obsoletes RFC 2570.
