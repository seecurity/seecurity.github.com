IPv4 and IPv6 Infrastructure Addresses

These two address spaces are independent, and the address family (IPv4 or IPv6) of the two spaces may or may not be the same.  These routes always contain an address family field that specifies whether the customer addresses are IPv4 addresses or whether they are IPv6 addresses.  However, there is no field that explicitly specifies the address family of the provider addresses.
