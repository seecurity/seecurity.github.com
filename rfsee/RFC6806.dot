Kerberos Principal Name Canonicalization
and Cross-Realm Referrals
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This memo documents a method for a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) to respond to client requests for Kerberos tickets when the client does not have detailed configuration information on the realms of users or services.  The KDC will handle requests for principals in other realms by returning either a referral error or a cross-realm Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT) to another realm on the referral path.  The clients will use this referral information to reach the realm of the target principal and then receive the ticket.  This memo also provides a mechanism for verifying that a request has not been tampered with in transit.  This memo updates RFC 4120. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A Generalized Framework for Kerberos
Pre-Authentication
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6113.html", target="_top", tooltip="Kerberos is a protocol for verifying the identity of principals (e.g., a workstation user or a network server) on an open network. The Kerberos protocol provides a facility called pre-authentication. Pre-authentication mechanisms can use this facility to extend the Kerberos protocol and prove the identity of a principal. This document describes a more formal model for this facility. The model describes what state in the Kerberos request a pre-authentication mechanism is likely to change. It also describes how multiple pre-authentication mechanisms used in the same request will interact. This document also provides common tools needed by multiple pre-authentication mechanisms. One of these tools is a secure channel between the client and the key distribution center with a reply key strengthening mechanism; this secure channel can be used to protect the authentication exchange and thus eliminate offline dictionary attacks. With these tools, it is relatively straightforward to chain multiple authentication mechanisms, utilize a different key management system, or support a new key agreement algorithm.
