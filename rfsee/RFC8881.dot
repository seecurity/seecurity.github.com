Network File System (NFS) Version 4
Minor Version 1 Protocol

The later minor version has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and is considered a separate protocol. This document obsoletes RFC 5661. It substantially revises the treatment of features relating to multi-server namespace, superseding the description of those features appearing in RFC 5661."];

Network File System (NFS) Version 4
Minor Version 1 Protocol

Major extensions introduced in NFS version 4 minor version 1 include Sessions, Directory Delegations, and parallel NFS (pNFS).  NFS version 4 minor version 1 has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and it is considered a separate protocol.  Thus, this document neither updates nor obsoletes RFC 3530.  NFS minor version 1 is deemed superior to NFS minor version 0 with no loss of functionality, and its use is preferred over version 0.  Both NFS minor versions 0 and 1 can be used simultaneously on the same network, between the same client and server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Reporting Errors in NFSv4.2 via
LAYOUTRETURN
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9737.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) allows for a file's metadata and data to be on different servers (i.e., the metadata server (MDS) and the data server (DS)).  When the MDS is restarted, the client can still modify the data file component.  During the recovery phase of startup, the MDS and the DSs work together to recover state.  If the client has not encountered errors with the data files, then the state can be recovered and the resilvering of the data files can be avoided.  With any errors, there is no means by which the client can report errors to the MDS.  As such, the MDS has to assume that a file needs resilvering.  This document presents an extension to RFC 8435 to allow the client to update the metadata via LAYOUTRETURN and avoid the resilvering."];

Extensions for Weak Cache Consistency in

2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9766.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies extensions to NFSv4.2 for improving Weak Cache Consistency (WCC).  These extensions introduce mechanisms that ensure partial writes performed under a Parallel NFS (pNFS) layout remain coherent and correctly tracked.  The solution addresses concurrency and data integrity concerns that may arise when multiple clients write to the same file through separate data servers.  By defining additional interactions among clients, metadata servers, and data servers, this specification enhances the reliability of NFSv4 in parallel-access environments and ensures consistency across diverse deployment scenarios."];
