Requirements for Subscription to YANG
Datastores

Based on criteria negotiated as part of a subscription, updates will be pushed to targeted recipients.  Such a capability eliminates the need for periodic polling of YANG datastores by applications and fills a functional gap in existing YANG transports (i.e., Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) and RESTCONF).  Such a service can be summarized as a pub/sub service for YANG datastore updates.  Beyond a set of basic requirements for the service, various refinements are addressed.  These refinements include: periodicity of object updates, filtering out of objects underneath a requested a subtree, and delivery QoS guarantees."];
