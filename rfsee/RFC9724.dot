State of Affairs for Randomized and
Changing Media Access Control (MAC)
Addresses
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Internet users are becoming more aware that their activity over the Internet leaves a vast digital footprint, that communications might not always be properly secured, and that their location and actions can be tracked. One of the main factors that eases tracking of Internet users is the wide use of long-lasting, and sometimes persistent, identifiers at various protocol layers. This document focuses on Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. There have been several initiatives within the IETF and the IEEE 802 standards committees to address some of the privacy issues involved. This document provides an overview of these activities to help coordinate standardization activities in these bodies.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP)
Quadrant Selection Option for DHCPv6
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8948.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IEEE originally structured the 48-bit Media Access Control (MAC) address space in such a way that half of it was reserved for local use. In 2017, the IEEE published a new standard (IEEE Std 802c) with a new optional Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP). It specifies different assignment approaches in four specified regions of the local MAC address space. The IEEE is developing protocols to assign addresses (IEEE P802.1CQ). There is also work in the IETF on specifying a new mechanism that extends DHCPv6 operation to handle the local MAC address assignments. This document proposes extensions to DHCPv6 protocols to enable a DHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6 relay to indicate a preferred SLAP quadrant to the server so that the server may allocate MAC addresses in the quadrant requested by the relay or client. A new DHCPv6 option (QUAD) is defined for this purpose."];

Changing addresses over time limits the window of time during which eavesdroppers and other information collectors may trivially perform address-based network-activity correlation when the same address is employed for multiple transactions by the same host.  Additionally, it reduces the window of exposure of a host as being accessible via an address that becomes revealed as a result of active communication.  This document obsoletes RFC 4941."];

This method is meant to be an alternative to generating Interface Identifiers based on hardware addresses (e.g., IEEE LAN Media Access Control (MAC) addresses), such that the benefits of stable addresses can be achieved without sacrificing the security and privacy of users.  The method specified in this document applies to all prefixes a host may be employing, including link-local, global, and unique-local prefixes (and their corresponding addresses)."];
