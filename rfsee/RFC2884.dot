Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable
Throughput (L4S) Internet Service:
Architecture
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9330.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet applications to achieve low queuing latency, low congestion loss, and scalable throughput control. L4S is based on the insight that the root cause of queuing delay is in the capacity-seeking congestion controllers of senders, not in the queue itself. With the L4S architecture, all Internet applications could (but do not have to) transition away from congestion control algorithms that cause substantial queuing delay and instead adopt a new class of congestion controls that can seek capacity with very little queuing. These are aided by a modified form of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) from the network. With this new architecture, applications can have both low latency and high throughput. The architecture primarily concerns incremental deployment. It defines mechanisms that allow the new class of L4S congestion controls to coexist with 'Classic' congestion controls in a shared network. The aim is for L4S latency and throughput to be usually much better (and rarely worse) while typically not impacting Classic performance."];

Guidelines for Adding Congestion
Notification to Protocols that
Encapsulate IP
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9599.html", target="_top", tooltip="The purpose of this document is to guide the design of congestion notification in any lower-layer or tunnelling protocol that encapsulates IP.  The aim is for explicit congestion signals to propagate consistently from lower-layer protocols into IP.  Then, the IP internetwork layer can act as a portability layer to carry congestion notification from non-IP-aware congested nodes up to the transport layer (L4).  Specifications that follow these guidelines, whether produced by the IETF or other standards bodies, should assure interworking among IP-layer and lower-layer congestion notification mechanisms.  This document is included in BCP 89 and updates the single paragraph of advice to subnetwork designers about Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in Section 13 of RFC 3819 by replacing it with a reference to this document."];
