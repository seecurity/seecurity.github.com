Allocating and Retiring Special-Purpose
MPLS Labels
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7274.html", target="_top", tooltip="Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes. A block of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end; these labels are commonly called reserved labels. They will be called special-purpose labels in this document. As there are only 16 of these special-purpose labels, caution is needed in the allocation of new special-purpose labels; yet, at the same time, forward progress should be allowed when one is called for. This memo defines new procedures for the allocation and retirement of special-purpose labels, as well as a method to extend the special-purpose label space and a description of how to handle extended special-purpose labels in the data plane. Finally, this memo renames the IANA registry for special-purpose labels to Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values and creates a new registry called the Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values registry. This document updates a number of previous RFCs that use the term reserved label. Specifically, this document updates RFCs 3032, 3038, 3209, 3811, 4182, 4928, 5331, 5586, 5921, 5960, 6391, 6478, and 6790."];
