Report from the IAB COVID-19 Network
Impacts Workshop 2020
2021", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused changes in Internet user behavior, particularly during the introduction of initial quarantine and work-from-home arrangements. These behavior changes drove changes in Internet traffic. The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss network impacts of the pandemic on November 9-13, 2020. The workshop was held to convene interested researchers, network operators, network management experts, and Internet technologists to share their experiences. The meeting was held online given the ongoing travel and contact restrictions at that time. Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions."];

Operational Considerations for Streaming
Media
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9317.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides an overview of operational networking and transport protocol issues that pertain to the quality of experience (QoE) when streaming video and other high-bitrate media over the Internet. This document explains the characteristics of streaming media delivery that have surprised network designers or transport experts who lack specific media expertise, since streaming media highlights key differences between common assumptions in existing networking practices and observations of media delivery issues encountered when streaming media over those existing networks."];

Considerations on Application - Network
Collaboration Using Path Signals
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9419.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses principles for designing mechanisms that use or provide path signals and calls for standards action in specific valuable cases.  RFC 8558 describes path signals as messages to or from on-path elements and points out that visible information will be used whether or not it is intended as a signal.  The principles in this document are intended as guidance for the design of explicit path signals, which are encouraged to be authenticated and include a minimal set of parties to minimize information sharing.  These principles can be achieved through mechanisms like encryption of information and establishing trust relationships between entities on a path."];
