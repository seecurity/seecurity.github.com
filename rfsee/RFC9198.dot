Advanced Stream and Sampling Framework

The existing framework mostly assumes deterministic connectivity, and that a single test stream will represent the characteristics of the path when it is aggregated with other flows.  Networks have evolved and test stream descriptions must evolve with them; otherwise, unexpected network features may dominate the measured performance.
