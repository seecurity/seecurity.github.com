The network mail path service fills the current need of people to determine mailbox addresses for hosts that are not part of the ARPA-Internet but can be reached by one or more relay hosts that have Unix to Unix Copy (UUCP) mail, CSNET mail, MAILNET mail, BITNET mail, etc.  Anyone can use the service if they have TCP/TELENET to one of the hosts with a mail path server.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
