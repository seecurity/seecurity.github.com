Internet of Things (IoT) Security: State
of the Art and Challenges
2019", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication. The security needs for IoT systems are well recognized, and many standardization steps to provide security have been taken -- for example, the specification of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) secured with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). However, security challenges still exist, not only because there are some use cases that lack a suitable solution, but also because many IoT devices and systems have been designed and deployed with very limited security capabilities. In this document, we first discuss the various stages in the lifecycle of a thing. Next, we document the security threats to a thing and the challenges that one might face to protect against these threats. Lastly, we discuss the next steps needed to facilitate the deployment of secure IoT systems. This document can be used by implementers and authors of IoT specifications as a reference for details about security considerations while documenting their specific security challenges, threat models, and mitigations.

Distribution in Multimedia Internet
KEYing (MIKEY)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4738.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) specification describes several modes of key distribution solution that address multimedia scenarios (e.g., SIP calls and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) sessions) using pre-shared keys, public keys, and optionally a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  In the public-key mode, the Initiator encrypts a random key with the Responder's public key and sends it to the Responder.  In many communication scenarios, the Initiator may not know the Responder's public key, or in some cases the Responder's ID (e.g., call forwarding) in advance.  We propose a new MIKEY mode that works well in such scenarios.  This mode also enhances the group key management support in MIKEY; it supports member-initiated group key download (in contrast to group manager pushing the group keys to all members).  This document updates RFC 3830 with the RSA-R mode. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

IKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming Protocol
(MOBIKE)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4555.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the MOBIKE protocol, a mobility and multihoming extension to Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2).  MOBIKE allows the IP addresses associated with IKEv2 and tunnel mode IPsec Security Associations to change.  A mobile Virtual Private Network (VPN) client could use MOBIKE to keep the connection with the VPN gateway active while moving from one address to another.  Similarly, a multihomed host could use MOBIKE to move the traffic to a different interface if, for instance, the one currently being used stops working. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Design of the IKEv2 Mobility and

These extensions should enable an efficient management of IKE and IPsec Security Associations when a host possesses multiple IP addresses and/or where IP addresses of an IPsec host change over time (for example, due to mobility). This document discusses the involved network entities and the relationship between IKEv2 signaling and information provided by other protocols. Design decisions for the MOBIKE protocol, background information, and discussions within the working group are recorded. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Specifically, this document defines a LOCATOR_SET parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host to notify peers about alternate addresses at which it may be reached.  This document also defines how the parameter can be used to preserve communications across a change to the IP address used by one or both peer hosts.  The same LOCATOR_SET parameter can also be used to support end-host multihoming (as specified in RFC 8047).  This document obsoletes RFC 5206."];

Using Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
to Protect Firmware Packages

CMS is specified in RFC 3852.  A digital signature is used to protect the firmware package from undetected modification and to provide data origin authentication.  Encryption is optionally used to protect the firmware package from disclosure, and compression is optionally used to reduce the size of the protected firmware package.  A firmware package loading receipt can optionally be generated to acknowledge the successful loading of a firmware package.  Similarly, a firmware package load error report can optionally be generated to convey the failure to load a firmware package. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Trust Anchor Management Requirements
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6024.html", target="_top", tooltip="A trust anchor represents an authoritative entity via a public key and associated data.  The public key is used to verify digital signatures, and the associated data is used to constrain the types of information for which the trust anchor is authoritative.  A relying party uses trust anchors to determine if a digitally signed object is valid by verifying a digital signature using the trust anchor's public key, and by enforcing the constraints expressed in the associated data for the trust anchor.  This document describes some of the problems associated with the lack of a standard trust anchor management mechanism and defines requirements for data formats and push-based protocols designed to address these problems.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
