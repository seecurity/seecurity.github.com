Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisement Problem
Statement
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6104.html", target="_top", tooltip="When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers are configured to send IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) to convey information to nodes that enable them to autoconfigure on the network.  This information includes the implied default router address taken from the observed source address of the RA message, as well as on-link prefix information.  However, unintended misconfigurations by users or administrators, or possibly malicious attacks on the network, may lead to bogus RAs being present, which in turn can cause operational problems for hosts on the network.  In this document, we summarise the scenarios in which rogue RAs may be observed and present a list of possible solutions to the problem.  We focus on the unintended causes of rogue RAs in the text.  The goal of this text is to be Informational, and as such to present a framework around which solutions can be proposed and discussed.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Privacy Considerations for Protocols
Relying on IP Broadcast or Multicast

Some of these functions can only be implemented efficiently using such mechanisms.  When using broadcast or multicast messages, a passive observer in the same broadcast or multicast domain can trivially record these messages and analyze their content.  Therefore, designers of protocols that make use of broadcast or multicast messages need to take special care when designing their protocols."];

Neighbor Discovery Considerations in
IPv6 Deployments

IPv6 architecture. The protocol uses multicast in many messages. It
also assumes a security model where all nodes on a link are trusted.
Such a design might be inefficient in some scenarios (e.g., use of
multicast in wireless networks) or when nodes are not trustworthy
(e.g., public access networks). These security and operational issues
and the associated mitigation solutions are documented in more than
twenty RFCs. There is a need to track these issues and solutions in a
single document. To that aim, this document summarizes the published ND issues and
then describes how all these issues originate from three causes.
Addressing the issues is made simpler by addressing the causes. This
document also analyzes the mitigation solutions and demonstrates that
isolating hosts into different subnets and links can help to address
the three causes. Guidance is provided for selecting a suitable
isolation method to prevent potential ND issues."];
