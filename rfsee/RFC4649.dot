DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery

That mechanism is limited to queries for individual bindings.  In some situations individual binding queries may not be efficient, or even possible.

Protocol for Access Node Control
Mechanism in Broadband Networks
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6320.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP). ANCP operates between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node (e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)) in a multi-service reference architecture in order to perform operations related to Quality of Service, service, and subscribers. Use cases for ANCP are documented in RFC 5851. As well as describing the base ANCP protocol, this document specifies capabilities for Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) topology discovery, line configuration, and remote line connectivity testing. The design of ANCP allows for protocol extensions in other documents if they are needed to support other use cases and other access technologies. ANCP is based on the General Switch Management Protocol version 3 (GSMPv3) described in RFC 3292, but with many modifications and extensions, to the point that the two protocols are not interoperable. For this reason, ANCP was assigned a separate version number to distinguish it. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Using Device-Provided Location-Related

Location-related measurement information provides observations concerning properties related to the position of a Device; this information could be data about network attachment or about the physical environment.  A LIS is able to use the location-related measurement data to improve the accuracy of the location estimate it provides to the Device.  A basic set of location-related measurements are defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters."];

Network-based mobility management support is provided for those delegated IP prefixes just as it is provided for the mobile node's home address.  Even if the mobile router performs a handoff and changes its network point of attachment, mobility support is ensured for all the delegated IP prefixes and for all the IP nodes in the mobile network that use IP address configuration from those delegated IP prefixes."];
