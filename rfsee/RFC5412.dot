Lightweight Access Point Protocol
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In recent years, there has been a shift in wireless LAN (WLAN) product architectures from autonomous access points to centralized control of lightweight access points. The general goal has been to move most of the traditional wireless functionality such as access control (user authentication and authorization), mobility, and radio management out of the access point into a centralized controller. The IETF's CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) WG has identified that a standards-based protocol is necessary between a wireless Access Controller and Wireless Termination Points (the latter are also commonly referred to as Lightweight Access Points). This specification defines the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP), which addresses the CAPWAP's (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) protocol requirements. Although the LWAPP protocol is designed to be flexible enough to be used for a variety of wireless technologies, this specific document describes the base protocol and an extension that allows it to be used with the IEEE's 802.11 wireless LAN protocol.
