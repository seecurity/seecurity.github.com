Sieve Email Filtering: Reject and
Extended Reject Extensions
2009", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This memo updates the definition of the Sieve mail filtering language reject extension, originally defined in RFC 3028. A Joe-job is a spam run forged to appear as though it came from an innocent party, who is then generally flooded by automated bounces, Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs), and personal messages with complaints. The original Sieve reject action defined in RFC 3028 required use of MDNs for rejecting messages, thus contributing to the flood of Joe-job spam to victims of Joe-jobs. This memo updates the definition of the reject action to allow messages to be refused during the SMTP transaction, and defines the ereject action to require messages to be refused during the SMTP transaction, if possible. The ereject action is intended to replace the reject action wherever possible. The ereject action is similar to reject, but will always favor protocol-level message rejection. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Message Disposition Notification
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8098.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo defines a MIME content type that may be used by a Mail User Agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a message after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient. This content type is intended to be machine processable. Additional message header fields are also defined to permit Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender of a message. The purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary LAN-based systems, and are often referred to as read receipts, acknowledgements, or receipt notifications. The intention is to do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past. Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary LAN-based systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a multiprotocol messaging environment. To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of foreign addresses, in addition to those normally used in Internet Mail. Additional attributes may also be defined to support tunneling of foreign notifications through Internet Mail. This document is an Internet Standard. It obsoletes RFC 3798 and updates RFC 2046 (message/partial media type handling) and RFC 3461 (Original-Recipient header field generation requirement)."];
