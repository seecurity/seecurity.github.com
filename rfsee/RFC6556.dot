Testing Eyeball Happiness

This note describes a test that can be used to determine whether an application can reliably establish sessions quickly in a complex environment such as dual-stack (IPv4+IPv6) deployment or IPv6 deployment with multiple prefixes and upstream ingress filtering.  This test is not a test of a specific algorithm, but of the external behavior of the system as a black box.  Any algorithm that has the intended external behavior will be accepted by it.

Happy Eyeballs: Success with Dual-Stack
Hosts
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6555.html", target="_top", tooltip="When a server's IPv4 path and protocol are working, but the server's IPv6 path and protocol are not working, a dual-stack client application experiences significant connection delay compared to an IPv4-only client.  This is undesirable because it causes the dual- stack client to have a worse user experience.  This document specifies requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and provides an algorithm. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

TCP's Reaction to Soft Errors

This behavior reduces the likelihood of long delays between connection-establishment attempts that may arise in a number of scenarios, including one in which dual-stack nodes that have IPv6 enabled by default are deployed in IPv4 or mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environments.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Basic Socket Interface Extensions for
IPv6
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3493.html", target="_top", tooltip="The de facto standard Application Program Interface (API) for TCP/IP applications is the sockets interface.  Although this API was developed for Unix in the early 1980s it has also been implemented on a wide variety of non-Unix systems.  TCP/IP applications written using the sockets API have in the past enjoyed a high degree of portability and we would like the same portability with IPv6 applications.  But changes are required to the sockets API to support IPv6 and this memo describes these changes.  These include a new socket address structure to carry IPv6 addresses, new address conversion functions, and some new socket options.  These extensions are designed to provide access to the basic IPv6 features required by TCP and UDP applications, including multicasting, while introducing a minimum of change into the system and providing complete compatibility for existing IPv4 applications.  Additional extensions for advanced IPv6 features (raw sockets and access to the IPv6 extension headers) are defined in another document.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
