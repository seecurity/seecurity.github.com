Routing Loop Attack Using IPv6 Automatic
Tunnels: Problem Statement and Proposed
Mitigations
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document is concerned with security vulnerabilities in IPv6-in- IPv4 automatic tunnels.  These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to take advantage of inconsistencies between the IPv4 routing state and the IPv6 routing state.  The attack forms a routing loop that can be abused as a vehicle for traffic amplification to facilitate denial- of-service (DoS) attacks.  The first aim of this document is to inform on this attack and its root causes.  The second aim is to present some possible mitigation measures.  It should be noted that at the time of this writing there are no known reports of malicious attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities.  Nonetheless, these vulnerabilities can be activated by accidental misconfiguration.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

The Teredo servers are stateless, and only have to manage a small fraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the Teredo relays act as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the native IPv6 Internet.  The relays can also provide interoperability with hosts using other transition mechanisms such as 6to4. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Native IPv6 behind IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT

However, because it is designed to work without the involvement of Internet Service Providers, it has significant limitations (connectivity between IPv6 native addresses and Teredo addresses is uncertain; connectivity between Teredo addresses fails for some combinations of NAT types).  6a44 is a complementary solution that, being based on ISP cooperation, avoids these limitations.  At the beginning of 6a44 IPv6 addresses, it replaces the Teredo well-known prefix, present at the beginning of Teredo IPv6 addresses, with network-specific /48 prefixes assigned by local ISPs (an evolution similar to that from 6to4 to 6rd (IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures)).  The specification is expected to be complete enough for running code to be independently written and the solution to be incrementally deployed and used.
