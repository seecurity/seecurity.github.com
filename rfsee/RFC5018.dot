Default Address Selection for Internet
Protocol version 6 (IPv6)

The algorithms specify default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations.  They do not override choices made by applications or upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the development of more advanced mechanisms for address selection.  The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior.  In dual stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses - depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice-versa.  All IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers, must implement default address selection as defined in this specification. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

This is particularly problematic with IPv6-capable nodes that do not have off-link IPv6 connectivity (e.g., no default router).  This document describes how making this assumption causes problems and how these problems outweigh the benefits of this part of the conceptual sending algorithm.

Randomness Requirements for Security
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4086.html", target="_top", tooltip="Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these systems is dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar quantities. The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can result in pseudo-security. A sophisticated attacker may find it easier to reproduce the environment that produced the secret quantities and to search the resulting small set of possibilities than to locate the quantities in the whole of the potential number space. Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult. This document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for generating such quantities. It recommends the use of truly random hardware techniques and shows that the existing hardware on many systems can be used for this purpose. It provides suggestions to ameliorate the problem when a hardware solution is not available, and it gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for some applications.
