IPv6 Multicast VPN (MVPN) Support Using
PIM Control Plane and Selective Provider
Multicast Service Interface (S-PMSI)
Join Messages

It also contains an option that allows UDP-based messages, known as Selective Provider Multicast Service Interface (S-PMSI) Join messages, to be used to bind particular customer multicast flows to particular tunnels through a service provider's network.  This document extends the MVPN specification (RFC 6513) so that these options can be used when the customer multicast flows are IPv6 flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse

(Revised)

PIM-SM is a multicast routing protocol that can use the underlying unicast routing information base or a separate multicast-capable routing information base. It builds unidirectional shared trees rooted at a Rendezvous Point (RP) per group, and optionally creates shortest-path trees per source. This document obsoletes RFC 2362, an Experimental version of PIM-SM. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
