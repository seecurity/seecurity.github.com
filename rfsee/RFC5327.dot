Licklider Transmission Protocol -
Security Extensions
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) is intended to serve as a reliable convergence layer over single-hop deep-space radio frequency (RF) links. LTP does Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) of data transmissions by soliciting selective-acknowledgment reception reports. It is stateful and has no negotiation or handshakes. This document describes security extensions to LTP, and is part of a series of related documents describing LTP. This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.

Datagram Convergence Layers for the
Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant
Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol and
Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7122.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies the preferred method for transporting Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol data over the Internet using datagrams.  It covers convergence layers for the Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050), as well as the transportation of segments using the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) (RFC 5326).  UDP and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) are the candidate datagram protocols discussed.  UDP can only be used on a local network or in cases where the DTN node implements explicit congestion control.  DCCP addresses the congestion control problem, and its use is recommended whenever possible.  This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG) and represents the consensus of the DTNRG."];
