The benefit of this capability is that stale routes can be retained for a longer time upon session failure than is provided for by BGP Graceful Restart (as described in RFC 4724). A well-known BGP community called LLGR_STALE is introduced for marking stale routes retained for a longer time. A second well-known BGP community called NO_LLGR is introduced for marking routes for which these procedures should not be applied. We also specify that such long-lived stale routes be treated as the least preferred and that their advertisements be limited to BGP speakers that have advertised the capability. Use of this extension is not advisable in all cases, and we provide guidelines to help determine if it is. This memo updates RFC 6368 by specifying that the LLGR_STALE community must be propagated into, or out of, the path attributes exchanged between the Provider Edge (PE) and Customer Edge (CE) routers."];

IANA Registry and Processing
Recommendations for the First Nibble
Following a Label Stack
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9790.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document creates a new IANA registry (called the Post-Stack First Nibble registry) for the first nibble (4-bit field) immediately following an MPLS label stack. Furthermore, this document presents some requirements for registering new values and making the processing of MPLS packets easier and more robust. The relationship between the IANA Post-Stack First Nibble registry and the IP Version Numbers registry (RFC 2780) is described in this document. This document updates RFC 4928 by deprecating the heuristic method for identifying the type of packet encapsulated in MPLS."];

The IPv6 VPN Service Destination Option
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9837.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes an experiment in which VPN service information is encoded in an experimental IPv6 Destination Option. The experimental IPv6 Destination Option is called the VPN Service Option. One purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that the VPN Service Option can be deployed in a production network. Another purpose is to demonstrate that the security measures described in this document are sufficient to protect a VPN. Finally, this document encourages replication of the experiment."];

A Realization of Network Slices for 5G
Networks Using Current IP/MPLS
Technologies
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9889.html", target="_top", tooltip="Network slicing is a feature that was introduced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in Mobile Networks. Realization of 5G slicing implies requirements for all mobile domains, including the Radio Access Network (RAN), Core Network (CN), and Transport Network (TN). This document describes a network slice realization model for IP/MPLS networks with a focus on the Transport Network fulfilling the service objectives for 5G slicing connectivity. The realization model reuses many building blocks commonly used in service provider networks at the current time."];
