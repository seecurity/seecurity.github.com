A Framework for Defining Network
Complexity
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet there is no generally accepted definition of the term. Complexity metrics exist in a wide range of research papers, but most of these address only a particular aspect of a network, for example, the complexity of a graph or software. While it may be impossible to define a metric for overall network complexity, there is a desire to better understand the complexity of a network as a whole, as deployed today to provide Internet services. This document provides a framework to guide research on the topic of network complexity as well as some practical examples for trade-offs in networking. This document summarizes the work of the IRTF's Network Complexity Research Group (NCRG) at the time of its closure. It does not present final results, but a snapshot of an ongoing activity, as a basis for future work.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Report from the IAB Workshop on
Environmental Impact of Internet
Applications and Systems, 2022

The IAB ran an online workshop in December 2022 to explore and understand these impacts. The role of the workshop was to discuss the impacts and the evolving industry needs, and to identify areas for improvements and future work. A key goal of the workshop was to call further attention to the topic and bring together a diverse stakeholder community to discuss these issues.
