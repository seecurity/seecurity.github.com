Carrying Q.850 Codes in Reason Header
Fields in SIP (Session Initiation
Protocol) Responses
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Although the use of the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Reason header field in responses is considered in general in RFC 3326, its use is not specified for any particular response code.  Nonetheless, existing deployments have been using Reason header fields to carry failure-related Q.850 cause codes in SIP responses to INVITE requests that have been gatewayed to Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) systems.  This document normatively describes the use of the Reason header field in carrying Q.850 cause codes in SIP responses.

The Reason Header Field for the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3326.html", target="_top", tooltip="The REGISTER function is used in a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) system primarily to associate a temporary contact address with an address-of-record.  This contact is generally in the form of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), such as Contact: <sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com> and is generally dynamic and associated with the IP address or hostname of the SIP User Agent (UA).  The problem is that network topology may have one or more SIP proxies between the UA and the registrar, such that any request traveling from the user's home network to the registered UA must traverse these proxies.  The REGISTER method does not give us a mechanism to discover and record this sequence of proxies in the registrar for future use.  This document defines an extension header field, Path which provides such a mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
