MSML can be used, for example, to control media server conferencing features such as video layout and audio mixing, create sidebar conferences or personal mixes, and set the properties of media streams.  As well, clients can use MSML to define media processing dialogs, which may be used as parts of application interactions with users or conferences.

Guidelines for Writing an IANA

Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role.

Instead, compliant implementations taking part in out-of-band negotiations of media stream content indicate what events they support.

By labeling content with the specific codecs indicated to render the contained media, receiving systems can determine if the codecs are supported by the end system, and if not, can take appropriate action (such as rejecting the content, sending notification of the situation, transcoding the content to a supported type, fetching and installing the required codecs, further inspection to determine if it will be sufficient to support a subset of the indicated codecs, etc.) [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
