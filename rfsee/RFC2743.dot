Application Bridging for Federated
Access Beyond Web (ABFAB) Architecture
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7831.html", target="_top", tooltip="Over the last decade, a substantial amount of work has occurred in the space of federated access management. Most of this effort has focused on two use cases: network access and web-based access. However, the solutions to these use cases that have been proposed and deployed tend to have few building blocks in common. This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non-federated access management, including the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). The architecture addresses the problem of federated access management to primarily non-web-based services, in a manner that will scale to large numbers of Identity Providers, Relying Parties, and federations."];

To participate in an NFSv4 multi-domain file namespace, the server must offer a multi-domain-capable file system and support RPCSEC_GSS for user authentication.  In most instances, the server must also support identity-mapping services."];

UDP Usage Guidelines
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8085.html", target="_top", tooltip="The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms. This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP. Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), and ports. Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic. They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP. Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion control. This document obsoletes RFC 5405 and adds guidelines for multicast UDP usage."];

Generic Security Service API Version 2:
Java Bindings Update
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8353.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) offers application programmers uniform access to security services atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms. This document updates the Java bindings for the GSS-API that are specified in Generic Security Service API Version 2: Java Bindings Update (RFC 5653). This document obsoletes RFC 5653 by adding a new output token field to the GSSException class so that when the initSecContext or acceptSecContext methods of the GSSContext class fail, it has a chance to emit an error token that can be sent to the peer for debugging or informational purpose. The stream-based GSSContext methods are also removed in this version. The GSS-API is described at a language-independent conceptual level in Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2, Update 1 (RFC 2743). The GSS-API allows a caller application to authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis. Examples of security mechanisms defined for GSS-API are The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism (SPKM) (RFC 2025) and The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2 (RFC 4121)."];
