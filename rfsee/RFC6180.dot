It is nevertheless required that either kind of single-protocol network be able to provide transit service for the other protocol.  This is done by passing the other kind of routing information from one edge of the single-protocol network to the other, and by tunneling the other kind of data packet from one edge to the other.

An Incremental Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN)
for IPv6 Transition
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6264.html", target="_top", tooltip="Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected. As IPv4 address exhaustion approaches, IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues become more critical and less tractable.

Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) devices with integrated transition mechanisms can reduce the operational changes required during the IPv4 to IPv6 migration or coexistence period. This document proposes an incremental CGN approach for IPv6 transition. It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6 hosts and IPv4 access services for IPv4 hosts while leaving much of a legacy ISP network unchanged during the initial stage of IPv4 to IPv6 migration. Unlike CGN alone, incremental CGN also supports and encourages smooth transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks.
