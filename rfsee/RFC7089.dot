HTTP Framework for Time-Based Access to

It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps.  Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime.  TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource.  The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
