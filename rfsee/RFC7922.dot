Traceability: Framework and Information

It specifies the motivation, requirements, and use cases, and defines an information model for recording interactions between elements implementing the I2RS protocol.  This framework provides a consistent tracing interface for components implementing the I2RS architecture to record what was done, by which component, and when.  It aims to improve the management of I2RS implementations, and can be used for troubleshooting, auditing, forensics, and accounting purposes.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Problem Statement for the Interface to
the Routing System
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7920.html", target="_top", tooltip="Traditionally, routing systems have implemented routing and signaling (e.g., MPLS) to control traffic forwarding in a network. Route computation has been controlled by relatively static policies that define link cost, route cost, or import and export routing policies. Requirements have emerged to more dynamically manage and program routing systems due to the advent of highly dynamic data-center networking, on-demand WAN services, dynamic policy-driven traffic steering and service chaining, the need for real-time security threat responsiveness via traffic control, and a paradigm of separating policy-based decision-making from the router itself. These requirements should allow controlling routing information and traffic paths and extracting network topology information, traffic statistics, and other network analytics from routing systems. This document proposes meeting this need via an Interface to the Routing System (I2RS)."];

Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)
Access Control Model

The Syslog Protocol
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5424.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the syslog protocol, which is used to convey event notification messages. This protocol utilizes a layered architecture, which allows the use of any number of transport protocols for transmission of syslog messages. It also provides a message format that allows vendor-specific extensions to be provided in a structured way. This document has been written with the original design goals for traditional syslog in mind. The need for a new layered specification has arisen because standardization efforts for reliable and secure syslog extensions suffer from the lack of a Standards-Track and transport-independent RFC. Without this document, each other standard needs to define its own syslog packet format and transport mechanism, which over time will introduce subtle compatibility issues. This document tries to provide a foundation that syslog extensions can build on. This layered architecture approach also provides a solid basis that allows code to be written once for each syslog feature rather than once for each transport. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Requirements for Subscription to YANG

Such a service can be summarized as a pub/sub service for YANG datastore updates.  Beyond a set of basic requirements for the service, various refinements are addressed.  These refinements include: periodicity of object updates, filtering out of objects underneath a requested a subtree, and delivery QoS guarantees."];

Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
(ALTO) Deployment Considerations

This includes, but is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource.

Security-Related Requirements

The I2RS protocol is implemented by reusing portions of existing IETF protocols and adding new features to them.  One such reuse is of the security features of a secure transport (e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure SHell (SSH) Protocol, Datagram TLS (DTLS)) such as encryption, message integrity, mutual peer authentication, and anti-replay protection.  The new I2RS features to consider from a security perspective are as follows: a priority mechanism to handle multi-headed write transactions, an opaque secondary identifier that identifies an application using the I2RS client, and an extremely constrained read-only non-secure transport."];
