BATched Sparse (BATS) Coding Scheme for
Multi-hop Data Transport
2023", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In general, linear network coding can improve the network communication performance in terms of throughput, latency, and reliability.  BATched Sparse (BATS) code is a class of efficient linear network coding scheme with a matrix generalization of fountain codes as the outer code and batch-based linear network coding as the inner code.  This document describes a baseline BATS coding scheme for communication through multi-hop networks and discusses the related research issues towards a more sophisticated BATS coding scheme.

RaptorQ Forward Error Correction Scheme
for Object Delivery
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6330.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction (FEC) scheme, corresponding to FEC Encoding ID 6, for the RaptorQ FEC code and its application to reliable delivery of data objects. RaptorQ codes are a new family of codes that provide superior flexibility, support for larger source block sizes, and better coding efficiency than Raptor codes in RFC 5053. RaptorQ is also a fountain code, i.e., as many encoding symbols as needed can be generated on the fly by the encoder from the source symbols of a source block of data. The decoder is able to recover the source block from almost any set of encoding symbols of sufficient cardinality -- in most cases, a set of cardinality equal to the number of source symbols is sufficient; in rare cases, a set of cardinality slightly more than the number of source symbols is required. The RaptorQ code described here is a systematic code, meaning that all the source symbols are among the encoding symbols that can be generated. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

TinyMT32 Pseudorandom Number Generator
(PRNG)
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8682.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the TinyMT32 Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG), which produces 32-bit pseudorandom unsigned integers and aims at having a simple-to-use and deterministic solution.  This PRNG is a small-sized variant of the Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNG.  The main advantage of TinyMT32 over MT is the use of a small internal state, compatible with most target platforms that include embedded devices, while keeping reasonably good randomness that represents a significant improvement compared to the Park-Miller Linear Congruential PRNG.  However, neither the TinyMT nor MT PRNG is meant to be used for cryptographic applications."];

Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) Coding
and Congestion Control in Transport
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9265.html", target="_top", tooltip="Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) is a reliability mechanism that is distinct and separate from the retransmission logic in reliable transfer protocols such as TCP. FEC coding can help deal with losses at the end of transfers or with networks having non-congestion losses. However, FEC coding mechanisms should not hide congestion signals. This memo offers a discussion of how FEC coding and congestion control can coexist. Another objective is to encourage the research community to also consider congestion control aspects when proposing and comparing FEC coding solutions in communication systems. This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications Research Group (NWCRG). The scope of the document is end-to-end communications; FEC coding for tunnels is out of the scope of the document."];
