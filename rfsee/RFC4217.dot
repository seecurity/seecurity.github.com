Securing FTP with TLS
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism that can be used by FTP clients and servers to implement security and authentication using the TLS protocol defined by RFC 2246, The TLS Protocol Version 1.0., and the extensions to the FTP protocol defined by RFC 2228, FTP Security Extensions. It describes the subset of the extensions that are required and the parameters to be used, discusses some of the policy issues that clients and servers will need to take, considers some of the implications of those policies, and discusses some expected behaviours of implementations to allow interoperation. This document is intended to provide TLS support for FTP in a similar way to that provided for SMTP in RFC 2487, SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security, and HTTP in RFC 2817, Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1.. This specification is in accordance with RFC 959, File Transfer Protocol. It relies on RFC 2246, The TLS Protocol Version 1.0., and RFC 2228, FTP Security Extensions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8996.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document formally deprecates Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346). Accordingly, those documents have been moved to Historic status. These versions lack support for current and recommended cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms, and various government and industry profiles of applications using TLS now mandate avoiding these old TLS versions. TLS version 1.2 became the recommended version for IETF protocols in 2008 (subsequently being obsoleted by TLS version 1.3 in 2018), providing sufficient time to transition away from older versions. Removing support for older versions from implementations reduces the attack surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines library and product maintenance. This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC 4347) but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1. This document updates many RFCs that normatively refer to TLS version 1.0 or TLS version 1.1, as described herein. This document also updates the best practices for TLS usage in RFC 7525; hence, it is part of BCP 195."];

FTP Command and Extension Registry
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5797.html", target="_top", tooltip="Every version of the FTP specification has added a few new commands, with the early ones summarized in RFC 959.  RFC 2389 established a mechanism for specifying and negotiating FTP extensions.  The number of extensions, both those supported by the mechanism and some that are not, continues to increase.  An IANA registry of FTP Command and Feature names is established to reduce the likelihood of conflict of names and the consequent ambiguity.  This specification establishes that registry.

An FTP Application Layer Gateway (ALG)
for IPv6-to-IPv4 Translation
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6384.html", target="_top", tooltip="The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) has a very long history, and despite the fact that today other options exist to perform file transfers, FTP is still in common use. As such, in situations where some client computers only have IPv6 connectivity while many servers are still IPv4-only and IPv6-to-IPv4 translators are used to bridge that gap, it is important that FTP is made to work through these translators to the best possible extent. FTP has an active and a passive mode, both as original commands that are IPv4-specific and as extended, IP version agnostic commands. The only FTP mode that works without changes through an IPv6-to-IPv4 translator is extended passive. However, many existing FTP servers do not support this mode, and some clients do not ask for it. This document specifies a middlebox that may solve this mismatch. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Media Resource Control Protocol Version

MRCPv2 is not a stand-alone protocol -- it relies on other protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe, discover, and exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the media source or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above, allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the speech resource server.
