Gateway
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7956.html", target="_top", tooltip="The base TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides optimal pair-wise data frame forwarding for Layer 2 intra-subnet traffic but not for Layer 3 inter-subnet traffic. A centralized gateway solution is typically used for Layer 3 inter-subnet traffic forwarding but has the following issues: 1. Sub-optimum forwarding paths for inter-subnet traffic. 2. A centralized gateway that may need to support a very large number of gateway interfaces in a Data Center, one per tenant per Data Label used by that tenant, to provide interconnect functionality for all the Layer 2 Virtual Networks in a TRILL campus. 3. A traffic bottleneck at the gateway. This document specifies an optional TRILL distributed gateway solution that resolves these centralized gateway issues."];

Guidelines for Defining Packet
Timestamps
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8877.html", target="_top", tooltip="Various network protocols make use of binary-encoded timestamps that are incorporated in the protocol packet format, referred to as packet timestamps for short.  This document specifies guidelines for defining packet timestamp formats in networking protocols at various layers.  It also presents three recommended timestamp formats.  The target audience of this document includes network protocol designers.  It is expected that a new network protocol that requires a packet timestamp will, in most cases, use one of the recommended timestamp formats.  If none of the recommended formats fits the protocol requirements, the new protocol specification should specify the format of the packet timestamp according to the guidelines in this document."];
