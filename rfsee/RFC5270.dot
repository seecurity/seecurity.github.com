Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5268.html", target="_top", tooltip="Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node (MN) to maintain its connectivity to the Internet when moving from one Access Router to another, a process referred to as handover.  During handover, there is a period during which the Mobile Node is unable to send or receive packets because of link switching delay and IP protocol operations.  This handover latency resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures, namely movement detection, new Care-of Address configuration, and Binding Update, is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP (VoIP).  Reducing the handover latency could be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as well.  This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures.  This document does not address improving the link switching latency. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Mobility Support in IPv6
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3775.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a protocol which allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Unified Layer 2 (L2) Abstractions for
Layer 3 (L3)-Driven Fast Handover
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5184.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document proposes unified Layer 2 (L2) abstractions for Layer 3 (L3)-driven fast handovers.  For efficient network communication, it is vital for a protocol layer to know or utilize other layers' information, such as the form of L2 triggers.  However, each protocol layer is basically designed independently.  Since each protocol layer is also implemented independently in current operating systems, it is very hard to exchange control information between protocol layers.  This document defines nine kinds of L2 abstractions in the form of primitives to achieve fast handovers in the network layer as a means of solving the problem.  This mechanism is called L3-driven fast handovers because the network layer initiates L2 and L3 handovers by using the primitives.  This document is a product of the IP Mobility Optimizations (MobOpts) Research Group.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];
