AI Sarcasm Detection: Insult Your AI
without Offending It
2023", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This RFC proposes a framework for detecting sarcasm in AI systems and provides guidelines for using sarcasm without causing offense.  By training AI systems to identify linguistic patterns that indicate sarcasm, we can improve their understanding of human communication.  The guidelines offer a lighthearted approach to using sarcasm in a way that is both effective and respectful, without crossing the line into offensive language."];

The Syslog Protocol
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5424.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the syslog protocol, which is used to convey event notification messages. This protocol utilizes a layered architecture, which allows the use of any number of transport protocols for transmission of syslog messages. It also provides a message format that allows vendor-specific extensions to be provided in a structured way. This document has been written with the original design goals for traditional syslog in mind. The need for a new layered specification has arisen because standardization efforts for reliable and secure syslog extensions suffer from the lack of a Standards-Track and transport-independent RFC. Without this document, each other standard needs to define its own syslog packet format and transport mechanism, which over time will introduce subtle compatibility issues. This document tries to provide a foundation that syslog extensions can build on. This layered architecture approach also provides a solid basis that allows code to be written once for each syslog feature rather than once for each transport. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
