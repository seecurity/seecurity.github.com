Service Undiscovery Using Hide-and-Go-
Seek for the Domain Pseudonym System
(DPS)
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="With the ubiquitous success of service discovery techniques, curious clients are faced with an increasing overload of service instances and options listed when they browse for services. A typical domain may contain web servers, remote desktop servers, printers, file servers, video content servers, automatons, Points of Presence using artificial intelligence, etc., all advertising their presence. Unsurprisingly, it is expected that some protocols and services will choose the comfort of anonymity and avoid discovery. This memo describes a new experimental protocol for this purpose utilizing the Domain Pseudonym System (DPS), and discusses strategies for its successful implementation and deployment. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

IANA Considerations for Three Letter
Acronyms
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5513.html", target="_top", tooltip="Three Letter Acronyms (TLAs) are commonly used to identify components of networks or protocols as designed or specified within the IETF. A common concern is that one acronym may have multiple expansions. While this may not have been an issue in the past, network convergence means that protocols that did not previously operate together are now found in close proximity. This results in contention for acronyms, and confusion in interpretation. Such confusion has the potential to degrade the performance of the Internet as misunderstandings lead to misconfiguration or other operating errors. Given the growing use of TLAs and the relatively small number available, this document specifies a Badly Construed Proposal (BCP) for the management of a registry of TLAs within the IETF, and the procedures for the allocation of new TLAs from the registry. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
