Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
Encapsulated in Large Packets
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol is commonly
used to verify connectivity between two systems. BFD packets are
typically very small. It is desirable in some circumstances to know
not only that the path between two systems is reachable, but also
that it is capable of carrying a payload of a particular size. This
document specifies how to implement such a mechanism using BFD in
Asynchronous mode. YANG modules for managing this mechanism are also defined in this
document. These YANG modules augment the existing BFD YANG modules
