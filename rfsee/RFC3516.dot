Collected Extensions to IMAP4 ABNF
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4466.html", target="_top", tooltip="Over the years, many documents from IMAPEXT and LEMONADE working groups, as well as many individual documents, have added syntactic extensions to many base IMAP commands described in RFC 3501. For ease of reference, this document collects most of such ABNF changes in one place. This document also suggests a set of standard patterns for adding options and extensions to several existing IMAP commands defined in RFC 3501. The patterns provide for compatibility between existing and future extensions. This document updates ABNF in RFCs 2088, 2342, 3501, 3502, and 3516. It also includes part of the errata to RFC 3501. This document doesn't specify any semantic changes to the listed RFCs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

IMAP4 Non-synchronizing Literals
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7888.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet Message Access Protocol (RFC 3501) contains the literal syntactic construct for communicating strings. When sending a literal from client to server, IMAP requires the client to wait for the server to send a command continuation request between sending the octet count and the string data. This document specifies an alternate form of literal that does not require this network round trip. This document specifies 2 IMAP extensions: LITERAL+ and LITERAL-. LITERAL+ allows the alternate form of literals in all IMAP commands. LITERAL- is the same as LITERAL+, but it disallows the alternate form of literals unless they are 4096 bytes or less.

IMAP4rev2 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders. IMAP4rev2 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server. IMAP4rev2 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes; checking for new messages; removing messages permanently; setting and clearing flags; parsing per RFCs 5322, 2045, and 2231; searching; and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof. Messages in IMAP4rev2 are accessed by the use of numbers. These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers. IMAP4rev2 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail submission protocol such as the one specified in RFC 6409."];
