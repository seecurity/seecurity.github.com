Caller Preferences for the Session

Requesting Answering Modes for the
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

The first header, Answer-Mode, expresses a preference as to whether the target node's user interface waits for user input before accepting the request or, instead, accepts the request without waiting on user input.  The second header, Priv-Answer-Mode, is similar to the first, except that it requests administrative-level access and has consequent additional authentication and authorization requirements.  These behaviors have applicability to applications such as push-to-talk and to diagnostics like loop-back.  Usage of each header field in a response to indicate how the request was handled is also defined. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Managing Client-Initiated Connections in

However, in a large number of real deployments, many practical considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs) or the use of TLS with server-provided certificates, prevent servers from connecting to User Agents in this way.  This specification defines behaviors for User Agents, registrars, and proxy servers that allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent.  It also defines keep-alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple connections from the User Agent to its registrar. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The model and actions described here are specifically chosen to be independent of the SIP signaling and/or mixing approach chosen to actually set up the media relationships.  In addition to its dialog manipulation aspect, this framework includes requirements for communicating related information and events such as conference and session state and session history.  This framework also describes other goals that embody the spirit of SIP applications as used on the Internet such as the definition of primitives (not services), invoker and participant oriented primitives, signaling and mixing model independence, and others.
