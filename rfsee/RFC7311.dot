The Accumulated IGP Metric Attribute for
BGP
2014", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Routing protocols that have been designed to run within a single administrative domain (IGPs) generally do so by assigning a metric to each link and then choosing, as the installed path between two nodes, the path for which the total distance (sum of the metric of each link along the path) is minimized.  BGP, designed to provide routing over a large number of independent administrative domains (autonomous systems), does not make its path-selection decisions through the use of a metric.  It is generally recognized that any attempt to do so would incur significant scalability problems as well as inter-administration coordination problems.  However, there are deployments in which a single administration runs several contiguous BGP networks.  In such cases, it can be desirable, within that single administrative domain, for BGP to select paths based on a metric, just as an IGP would do.  The purpose of this document is to provide a specification for doing so.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

BGP Color-Aware Routing (CAR)
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9871.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a BGP-based routing solution to establish end-to-end intent-aware paths across a multi-domain transport network. The transport network can span multiple service provider and customer network domains. The BGP intent-aware paths can be used to steer traffic flows for service routes that need a specific intent. This solution is called BGP Color-Aware Routing (BGP CAR). This document describes the routing framework and BGP extensions to enable intent-aware routing using the BGP CAR solution. The solution defines two new BGP SAFIs (BGP CAR SAFI and BGP VPN CAR SAFI) for IPv4 and IPv6. It also defines an extensible Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) model for both SAFIs that allows multiple NLRI types to be defined for different use cases. Each type of NLRI contains key and TLV-based non-key fields for efficient encoding of different per-prefix information. This specification defines two NLRI types: Color-Aware Route NLRI and IP Prefix NLRI. It defines non-key TLV types for the MPLS label stack, SR-MPLS label index, and Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) Segment Identifiers (SIDs). This solution also defines a new Local Color Mapping (LCM) Extended Community."];
