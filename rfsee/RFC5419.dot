Why the Authentication Data Suboption is
Needed for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)
2009", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Mobile IPv6 defines a set of signaling messages that enable the mobile node (MN) to authenticate and perform registration with its home agent (HA).  These authentication signaling messages between the mobile node and home agent are secured by an IPsec security association (SA) that is established between the MN and HA.  The MIP6 working group has specified a mechanism to secure the Binding Update (BU) and Binding Acknowledgement (BAck) messages using an authentication option, similar to the authentication option in Mobile IPv4, carried within the signaling messages that are exchanged between the MN and HA to establish a binding.  This document provides the justifications as to why the authentication option mechanism is needed for Mobile IPv6 deployment in certain environments.

Mobility Support in IPv6
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3775.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a protocol which allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping in Split
Scenario
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5026.html", target="_top", tooltip="A Mobile IPv6 node requires a Home Agent address, a home address, and IPsec security associations with its Home Agent before it can start utilizing Mobile IPv6 service.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these are statically configured.  This document defines how a Mobile IPv6 node can bootstrap this information from non-topological information and security credentials pre-configured on the Mobile Node.  The solution defined in this document solves the split scenario described in the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem statement in RFC 4640.  The split scenario refers to the case where the Mobile Node's mobility service is authorized by a different service provider than basic network access.  The solution described in this document is also generically applicable to any bootstrapping case, since other scenarios are more specific realizations of the split scenario. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
