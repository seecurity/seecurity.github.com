ZRTP can utilize a Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication through the signaling channel.

The OPAQUE Augmented Password-
Authenticated Key Exchange (aPAKE)
Protocol
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9807.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the OPAQUE protocol, an Augmented (or Asymmetric) Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (aPAKE) protocol that supports mutual authentication in a client-server setting without reliance on PKI and with security against pre-computation attacks upon server compromise.  In addition, the protocol provides forward secrecy and the ability to hide the password from the server, even during password registration.  This document specifies the core OPAQUE protocol and one instantiation based on 3DH.  This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF."];

Authentication Service Based on the
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
for Use with the Constrained Application
Protocol (CoAP)
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9820.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies an authentication service that uses the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as a transport method to carry the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).  As such, it defines an EAP lower layer based on CoAP called CoAP-EAP.  One of the main goals is to authenticate a CoAP-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) device (EAP peer) that intends to join a security domain managed by a Controller (EAP authenticator).  Secondly, it allows deriving key material to protect CoAP messages exchanged between them based on Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), enabling the establishment of a security association between them."];
