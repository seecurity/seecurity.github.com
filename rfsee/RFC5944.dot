IP Mobility Support for IPv4, Revised
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent routing of IP datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about its current point of attachment to the Internet.  The protocol provides for registering the care-of address with a home agent.  The home agent sends datagrams destined for the mobile node through a tunnel to the care-of address.  After arriving at the end of the tunnel, each datagram is then delivered to the mobile node. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

NSIS Operation over IP Tunnels
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5979.html", target="_top", tooltip="NSIS Quality of Service (QoS) signaling enables applications to perform QoS reservation along a data flow path.  When the data flow path contains IP tunnel segments, NSIS QoS signaling has no effect within those tunnel segments.  Therefore, the resulting tunnel segments could become the weakest QoS link and invalidate the QoS efforts in the rest of the end-to-end path.  The problem with NSIS signaling within the tunnel is caused by the tunnel encapsulation that masks packets' original IP header fields.  Those original IP header fields are needed to intercept NSIS signaling messages and classify QoS data packets.  This document defines a solution to this problem by mapping end-to-end QoS session requests to corresponding QoS sessions in the tunnel, thus extending the end-to-end QoS signaling into the IP tunnel segments.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) Key
Extension for Mobile IPv4
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6245.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) specification contains a Key field, which MAY contain a value that is used to identify a particular GRE data stream.  This specification defines a new Mobile IP extension that is used to exchange the value to be used in the GRE Key field.  This extension further allows the Mobility Agents to set up the necessary protocol interfaces prior to receiving the mobile node traffic.  The new extension allows a Foreign Agent to request GRE tunneling without disturbing the Home Agent behavior specified for Mobile IPv4.  GRE tunneling with the Key field allows the operators to have home networks that consist of multiple Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which may have overlapping home addresses.  When the tuple <Care of Address, Home Address, and Home Agent Address> is the same across multiple subscriber sessions, GRE tunneling will provide a means for the Foreign Agent and Home Agent to identify data streams for the individual sessions based on the GRE key.  In the absence of this key identifier, the data streams cannot be distinguished from each other -- a significant drawback when using IP-in-IP tunneling. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

MPA is a mobile- assisted, secure handover optimization scheme that works over any link layer and with any mobility management protocol, and is most applicable to supporting optimization during inter-domain handover. MPA's pre-authentication, pre-configuration, and proactive handover techniques allow many of the handoff-related operations to take place before the mobile node has moved to the new network. We describe the details of all the associated techniques and their applicability for different scenarios involving various mobility protocols during inter-domain handover.

In the future, the ELOC space will only be significant in a private network or in a service provider domain. Therefore, a 32x32 bit addressing scheme and a hierarchical routing architecture are achieved. The hierarchical IPv4 framework is backwards compatible with the current IPv4 Internet. This document also discusses a method for decoupling the location and identifier functions -- future applications can make use of the separation. The framework requires extensions to the existing Domain Name System (DNS), the existing IPv4 stack of the endpoints, middleboxes, and routers in the Internet.
