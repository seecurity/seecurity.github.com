Planning for Protocol Adoption and

Many protocols and technologies were not designed to enable smooth transition to alternatives or to easily deploy extensions; thus, some transitions, such as the introduction of IPv6, have been difficult.

TCP User Timeout Option

It is a local, per-connection parameter.  This document specifies a new TCP option -- the TCP User Timeout Option -- that allows one end of a TCP connection to advertise its current user timeout value.  This information provides advice to the other end of the TCP connection to adapt its user timeout accordingly.  Increasing the user timeouts on both ends of a TCP connection allows it to survive extended periods without end-to-end connectivity.  Decreasing the user timeouts allows busy servers to explicitly notify their clients that they will maintain the connection state only for a short time without connectivity. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Happy Eyeballs Version 2: Better
Connectivity Using Concurrency
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8305.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use hostnames.  These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of which may have different performance and connectivity characteristics.  Since specific addresses or address families (IPv4 or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of establishing a connection more quickly.
