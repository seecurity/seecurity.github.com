LDP IGP Synchronization
2009", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In certain networks, there is dependency on the edge-to-edge Label Switched Paths (LSPs) setup by the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), e.g., networks that are used for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications.  For such applications, it is not possible to rely on Internet Protocol (IP) forwarding if the MPLS LSP is not operating appropriately.  Blackholing of labeled traffic can occur in situations where the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) is operational on a link on which LDP is not.  While the link could still be used for IP forwarding, it is not useful for MPLS forwarding, for example, MPLS VPN applications or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route-free cores.  This document describes a mechanism to avoid traffic loss due to this condition without introducing any protocol changes.

LDP IGP Synchronization for Broadcast
Networks

If this mechanism is applied to broadcast links that have more than one LDP peer, the metric increase procedure can only be applied to the link as a whole but not to an individual peer.  When a new LDP peer comes up on a broadcast network, this can result in loss of traffic through other established peers on that network.  This document describes a mechanism to address that use-case without dropping traffic.  The mechanism does not introduce any protocol message changes.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

LDP Specification
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5036.html", target="_top", tooltip="The architecture for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is described in RFC 3031.  A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through them.  This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has made.  This document defines a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths.
