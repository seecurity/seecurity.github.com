Additional Criteria for Nominating
Committee Eligibility

It therefore also updates the criteria for qualifying signatories to a community recall petition.  The purpose is to make the criteria more flexible in view of increasing remote participation in the IETF and a reduction in face-to-face meetings.  The experiment is of fixed duration and will apply to one, or at most two, consecutive Nominating Committee cycles, starting in 2021.

A Model for IETF Process Experiments

The first mechanism has often proven to be too lightweight, the second too heavyweight. This document specifies a middle-ground approach to the system of making changes to IETF process, one that relies heavily on a propose and carry out an experiment, evaluate the experiment, and then establish permanent procedures based on operational experience model rather than those previously attempted. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
