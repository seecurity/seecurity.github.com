UDP Checksum Complement in the One-Way
Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and
Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol
(TWAMP)
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) are used for performance monitoring in IP networks.  Delay measurement is performed in these protocols by using timestamped test packets.  Some implementations use hardware-based timestamping engines that integrate the accurate transmission time into every outgoing OWAMP/TWAMP test packet during transmission.  Since these packets are transported over UDP, the UDP Checksum field is then updated to reflect this modification.  This document proposes to use the last 2 octets of every test packet as a Checksum Complement, allowing timestamping engines to reflect the checksum modification in the last 2 octets rather than in the UDP Checksum field.  The behavior defined in this document is completely interoperable with existing OWAMP/TWAMP implementations.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
