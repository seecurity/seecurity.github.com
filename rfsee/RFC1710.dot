Survey of Proposed Use Cases for the
IPv6 Flow Label
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6294.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IPv6 protocol includes a flow label in every packet header, but this field is not used in practice.  This paper describes the flow label standard and discusses the implementation issues that it raises.  It then describes various published proposals for using the flow label and shows that most of them are inconsistent with the standard.  Methods to address this problem are briefly reviewed.  We also question whether the standard should be revised.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Simple Internet Protocol (SIP)
Specification

The Simple Internet Protocol was the basis for one of the candidates for the IETF's Next Generation (IPng) work that became IPv6. The publication date of the original Internet-Draft was November 10, 1992. It is presented here substantially unchanged and is neither a complete document nor intended to be implementable. The paragraph that follows is the Abstract from the original draft. This document specifies a new version of IP called SIP, the Simple Internet Protocol. It also describes the changes needed to ICMP, IGMP, and transport protocols such as TCP and UDP, in order to work with SIP. A companion document [SIP-ADDR] describes the addressing and routing aspects of SIP, including issues of auto-configuration, host and subnet mobility, and multicast."];
