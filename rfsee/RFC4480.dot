RPID: Rich Presence Extensions to the
Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic format for representing presence information for a presentity. This format defines a textual note, an indication of availability (open or closed) and a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for communication. The Rich Presence Information Data format (RPID) described here is an extension that adds optional elements to the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF). These extensions provide additional information about the presentity and its contacts. The information is designed so that much of it can be derived automatically, e.g., from calendar files or user activity. This extension includes information about what the person is doing, a grouping identifier for a tuple, when a service or device was last used, the type of place a person is in, what media communications might remain private, the relationship of a service tuple to another presentity, the person's mood, the time zone it is located in, the type of service it offers, an icon reflecting the presentity's status, and the overall role of the presentity. These extensions include presence information for persons, services (tuples), and devices. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)
Extension for Partial Presence
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5262.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Presence Information Document Format (PIDF) specifies the baseline XML-based format for describing presence information.  One of the characteristics of the PIDF is that the document always needs to carry all presence information available for the presentity.  In some environments where low bandwidth and high latency links can exist, it is often beneficial to limit the amount of transported information over the network.  This document introduces a new MIME type that enables transporting of either only the changed parts or the full PIDF-based presence information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Publication of Partial Presence
Information
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5264.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication describes a mechanism with which a presence user agent is able to publish presence information to a presence agent.  Using the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF), each presence publication contains full state, regardless of how much of that information has actually changed since the previous update.  As a consequence, updating a sizeable presence document with small changes bears a considerable overhead and is therefore inefficient.  Especially with low bandwidth and high latency links, this can constitute a considerable burden to the system.  This memo defines a solution that aids in reducing the impact of those constraints and increases transport efficiency by introducing a mechanism that allows for publication of partial presence information.
