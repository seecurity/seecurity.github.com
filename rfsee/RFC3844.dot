IETF Problem Resolution Process
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This Informational document records the history of discussions in the Problem WG during 2003 of how to resolve the problems described in the IETF Problem Statement.  It decomposes each of the problems described into a few areas for improvement and categorizes them as either problems affecting the routine processes used to create standards or problems affecting the fundamental structure and practices of the IETF.  Expeditious and non-disruptive solutions are proposed for the problems affecting routine processes.  The document also lists suggested ways to handle the development of solutions for the structure and practices problems proposed in IETF discussions.  Neither the working group nor the wider IETF has reached consensus on a recommendation for any of the proposals.  This document therefore has no alternative but to suggest that the search for structure and practices solutions be handed back to the control of the IESG.  While there was working group consensus on the processes for short-term and medium term improvements, there was no working group consensus on the proposals for longer-term improvements.  This document therefore includes longer-term improvement proposals only as a matter of record; they must not be regarded as recommendations from the working group.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
