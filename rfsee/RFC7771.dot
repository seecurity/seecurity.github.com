Switching Provider Edge (S-PE)
Protection for MPLS and MPLS Transport
Profile (MPLS-TP) Static Multi-Segment
Pseudowires
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In MPLS and MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) environments, statically provisioned Single-Segment Pseudowires (SS-PWs) are protected against tunnel failure via MPLS-level and MPLS-TP-level tunnel protection.  With statically provisioned Multi-Segment Pseudowires (MS-PWs), each segment of the MS-PW is likewise protected from tunnel failures via MPLS-level and MPLS-TP-level tunnel protection.  However, static MS-PWs are not protected end-to-end against failure of one of the Switching Provider Edge Routers (S-PEs) along the path of the MS-PW.  This document describes how to achieve this protection via redundant MS-PWs by updating the existing procedures in RFC 6870.  It also contains an optional approach based on MPLS-TP Linear Protection."];

The mechanism allows PW Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) message mapping and PW redundancy to operate on static PWs.
