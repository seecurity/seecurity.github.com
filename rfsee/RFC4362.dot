RObust Header Compression (ROHC): A
Link-Layer Assisted Profile for
IP/UDP/RTP

The profile is built as an extension to the ROHC RTP profile.  It defines additional mechanisms needed in ROHC, states requirements on the assisting layer to guarantee transparency, and specifies general logic for compression and decompression related to the usage of the header-free packet format.  This document is a replacement for RFC 3242, which it obsoletes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
