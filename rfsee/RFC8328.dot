Policy-Based Management Framework for
the Simplified Use of Policy
Abstractions (SUPA)
2018", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) policy-based management framework defines base YANG data models to encode policy.  These models point to device-, technology-, and service-specific YANG data models developed elsewhere.  Policy rules within an operator's environment can be used to express high-level, possibly network-wide, policies to a network management function (within a controller, an orchestrator, or a network element).  The network management function can then control the configuration and/or monitoring of network elements and services.  This document describes the SUPA basic framework, its elements, and interfaces.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
