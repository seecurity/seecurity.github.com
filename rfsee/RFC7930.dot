A RADIUS Attribute, Binding, Profiles,
Name Identifier Format, and Confirmation
Methods for the Security Assertion
Markup Language (SAML)
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7833.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the use of the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) with RADIUS in the context of the Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) architecture.  It defines two RADIUS attributes, a SAML binding, a SAML name identifier format, two SAML profiles, and two SAML confirmation methods.  The RADIUS attributes permit encapsulation of SAML Assertions and protocol messages within RADIUS, allowing SAML entities to communicate using the binding.  The two profiles describe the application of this binding for ABFAB authentication and assertion Query/Request, enabling a Relying Party to request authentication of, or assertions for, users or machines (clients).  These clients may be named using a Network Access Identifier (NAI) name identifier format.  Finally, the subject confirmation methods allow requests and queries to be issued for a previously authenticated user or machine without needing to explicitly identify them as the subject.  The use of the artifacts defined in this document is not exclusive to ABFAB.  They can be applied in any Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) scenario, such as network access control."];
