This specification defines a second version of the profiles found in RFC 3095, RFC 3843 and RFC 4019; it supersedes their definition, but does not obsolete them. The ROHCv2 profiles introduce a number of simplifications to the rules and algorithms that govern the behavior of the compression endpoints. It also defines robustness mechanisms that may be used by a compressor implementation to increase the probability of decompression success when packets can be lost and/or reordered on the ROHC channel.
