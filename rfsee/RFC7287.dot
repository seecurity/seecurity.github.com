Mobility Support in IPv6
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6275.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Mobile IPv6, a protocol that allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.

Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) Multicast
Handover Optimization by the

2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7161.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies an experimental multicast handover optimization mechanism for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) to accelerate the delivery of multicast traffic to mobile nodes after handovers.  The mechanism, called Subscription Information Acquisition through the LMA (SIAL), is based on speeding up the acquisition of mobile nodes' multicast context by the mobile access gateways.  To do that, extensions to the current PMIPv6 protocol are proposed.  These extensions are not only applicable to the base solution for multicast support in Proxy Mobile IPv6, but they can also be applied to other solutions developed to avoid the tunnel convergence problem.  Furthermore, these extensions are also independent of the role played by the mobile access gateway within the multicast network (acting as either multicast listener discovery proxy or multicast router)."];
