Applicability of Ethernet Virtual

EVPN is a scalable solution for NVO3 networks and keeps the independence of the underlay IP Fabric, i.e., there is no need to enable Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) in the underlay network and maintain multicast states for tenant Broadcast Domains.  This document describes the use of EVPN for NVO3 networks and discusses its applicability to basic Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity requirements and to advanced features such as MAC Mobility, MAC Protection and Loop Protection, multihoming, Data Center Interconnect (DCI), and much more.

Optimized Ingress Replication Solution
for Ethernet VPNs (EVPNs)

PIM provides an efficient solution that prevents sending multiple copies of the same packet over the same physical link; however, it may not always be deployed in the NVO network core.  Ingress replication avoids the dependency on PIM in the NVO network core.  While ingress replication provides a simple multicast transport, some NVO networks with demanding multicast applications require a more efficient solution without PIM in the core.  This document describes a solution to optimize the efficiency of ingress replication trees."];

The proposed extensions improve the handling of host mobility and duplicate address detection in EVPN-IRB networks to cover a broader set of scenarios where a host's unicast IP address to Media Access Control (MAC) address bindings may change across moves.  These enhancements address limitations in the existing EVPN-IRB mobility procedures by providing more efficient and scalable solutions.

Neighbor Discovery Considerations in
IPv6 Deployments
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9898.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol is a critical component of the
IPv6 architecture. The protocol uses multicast in many messages. It
also assumes a security model where all nodes on a link are trusted.
Such a design might be inefficient in some scenarios (e.g., use of
multicast in wireless networks) or when nodes are not trustworthy
(e.g., public access networks). These security and operational issues
and the associated mitigation solutions are documented in more than
twenty RFCs. There is a need to track these issues and solutions in a
single document. To that aim, this document summarizes the published ND issues and
then describes how all these issues originate from three causes.
Addressing the issues is made simpler by addressing the causes. This
document also analyzes the mitigation solutions and demonstrates that
isolating hosts into different subnets and links can help to address
the three causes. Guidance is provided for selecting a suitable
isolation method to prevent potential ND issues."];
