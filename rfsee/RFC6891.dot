DNS Error Reporting
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9567.html", target="_top", tooltip="DNS error reporting is a lightweight reporting mechanism that provides the operator of an authoritative server with reports on DNS resource records that fail to resolve or validate. A domain owner or DNS hosting organization can use these reports to improve domain hosting. The reports are based on extended DNS errors as described in RFC 8914. When a domain name fails to resolve or validate due to a misconfiguration or an attack, the operator of the authoritative server may be unaware of this. To mitigate this lack of feedback, this document describes a method for a validating resolver to automatically signal an error to a monitoring agent specified by the authoritative server. The error is encoded in the QNAME; thus, the very act of sending the query is to report the error."];

Initializing a DNS Resolver with Priming

The DNS Zone Version (ZONEVERSION)
Option
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9660.html", target="_top", tooltip="The DNS ZONEVERSION option is a way for DNS clients to request, and for authoritative DNS servers to provide, information regarding the version of the zone from which a response is generated. The SERIAL field from the Start of Authority (SOA) resource record (RR) is a good example of a zone's version, and it is the only one defined by this specification. Additional version types may be defined by future specifications. Including zone version data in a response simplifies and improves the quality of debugging and diagnostics since the version and the DNS answer are provided atomically. This can be especially useful for zones and DNS providers that leverage IP anycast or multiple backend systems. It functions similarly to the DNS Name Server Identifier (NSID) option described in RFC 5001."];

IP Fragmentation Avoidance in DNS over
UDP
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9715.html", target="_top", tooltip="The widely deployed Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0)) feature in the DNS enables a DNS receiver to indicate its received UDP message size capacity, which supports the sending of large UDP responses by a DNS server.  Large DNS/UDP messages are more likely to be fragmented, and IP fragmentation has exposed weaknesses in application protocols.  It is possible to avoid IP fragmentation in DNS by limiting the response size where possible and signaling the need to upgrade from UDP to TCP transport where necessary.  This document describes techniques to avoid IP fragmentation in DNS."];
