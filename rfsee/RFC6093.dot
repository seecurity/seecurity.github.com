Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

TCP is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet.  Over this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion.  This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793.  This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793.  It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements.  It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state.  The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168."];

Problem Statement and Requirements for
Increased Accuracy in Explicit
Congestion Notification (ECN) Feedback
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7560.html", target="_top", tooltip="Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network nodes can mark IP packets, instead of dropping them, to indicate congestion to the endpoints.  An ECN-capable receiver will feed this information back to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that it can only feed back one congestion signal per Round-Trip Time (RTT).  In contrast, ECN for other transport protocols, such as RTP/UDP and SCTP, is specified with more accurate ECN feedback.  Recent new TCP mechanisms (like Congestion Exposure (ConEx) or Data Center TCP (DCTCP)) need more accurate ECN feedback in the case where more than one marking is received in one RTT.  This document specifies requirements for an update to the TCP protocol to provide more accurate ECN feedback."];
