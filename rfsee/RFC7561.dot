Mapping Quality of Service (QoS)
Procedures of Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)
and WLAN
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document provides guidelines for achieving end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domain where the access network is based on IEEE 802.11.  RFC 7222 describes QoS negotiation between a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in a PMIPv6 mobility domain.  The negotiated QoS parameters can be used for QoS policing and marking of packets to enforce QoS differentiation on the path between the MAG and LMA.  IEEE 802.11 and Wi-Fi Multimedia - Admission Control (WMM-AC) describe methods for QoS negotiation between a Wi-Fi Station (MN in PMIPv6 terminology) and an Access Point.  This document provides a mapping between the above two sets of QoS procedures and the associated QoS parameters.  This document is intended to be used as a companion document to RFC 7222 to enable implementation of end-to-end QoS."];

Mapping Diffserv to IEEE 802.11

This document specifies a set of mappings from Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to IEEE 802.11 User Priority (UP) to reconcile the marking recommendations offered by the IETF and the IEEE so as to maintain consistent QoS treatment between wired and IEEE 802.11 wireless networks."];
