Protocol Extensions for Header
Compression over MPLS
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4901.html", target="_top", tooltip="This specification defines how to use Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) to route Header-Compressed (HC) packets over an MPLS label switched path.  HC can significantly reduce packet-header overhead and, in combination with MPLS, can also increases bandwidth efficiency and processing scalability in terms of the maximum number of simultaneous compressed flows that use HC at each router).  Here we define how MPLS pseudowires are used to transport the HC context and control messages between the ingress and egress MPLS label switching routers.  This is defined for a specific set of existing HC mechanisms that might be used, for example, to support voice over IP.  This specification also describes extension mechanisms to allow support for future, as yet to be defined, HC protocols.  In this specification, each HC protocol operates independently over a single pseudowire instance, very much as it would over a single point-to-point link. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Updated Specification of the IPv4 ID
Field

If enforced, this uniqueness requirement would limit all connections to 6.4 Mbps for typical datagram sizes.  Because individual connections commonly exceed this speed, it is clear that existing systems violate the current specification.  This document updates the specification of the IPv4 ID field in RFCs 791, 1122, and 2003 to more closely reflect current practice and to more closely match IPv6 so that the field's value is defined only when a datagram is actually fragmented.
