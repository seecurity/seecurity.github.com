Mapping Characters for Internationalized

The IDNA2008 protocol (described in RFCs 5890, 5891, 5892, and 5893) presumes that the input to the protocol comes from a set of permitted code points, which it then encodes and passes to the DNS, but does not specify what to do with the result of user input.

Inclusion in Labels in the DNS
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6912.html", target="_top", tooltip="Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) makes available to DNS zone administrators a very wide range of Unicode code points.  Most operators of zones should probably not permit registration of U-labels using the entire range.

It is unfortunately not possible to generate algorithms to determine whether permitting a code point presents a low risk.

In addition, both the Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement describe mappings for internationalized strings that are not limited to case, but include width mapping and mapping of delimiters and other special characters that can be taken into consideration.  This document provides guidelines for designers of PRECIS profiles and describes several mappings that can be applied between receiving user input and passing permitted code points to internationalized protocols.

Selecting Labels for Use with

Systems in DNS-Based Service Discovery
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8222.html", target="_top", tooltip="Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) can use naming systems other than DNS when looking for services.  Moreover, when it uses DNS, DNS-SD uses the full capability of DNS, rather than using a subset of available octets.  This is of particular relevance where some environments use DNS labels that conform to Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA), and other environments use labels containing Unicode characters (such as containing octets corresponding to characters encoded as UTF-8).  In order for DNS-SD to be used effectively in environments where multiple different name systems and conventions for their operation are in use, it is important to attend to differences in the underlying technology and operational environment.  This memo presents an outline of the requirements for the selection of labels for conventional DNS and other resolution systems when they are expected to interoperate in this manner."];
