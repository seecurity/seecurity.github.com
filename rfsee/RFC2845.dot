Tunneling (AMT) Discovery
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8777.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document updates RFC 7450, Automatic Multicast Tunneling (or AMT), by modifying the relay discovery process.  A new DNS resource record named AMTRELAY is defined for publishing AMT relays for source-specific multicast channels.  The reverse IP DNS zone for a multicast sender's IP address is configured to use AMTRELAY resource records to advertise a set of AMT relays that can receive and forward multicast traffic from that sender over an AMT tunnel.  Other extensions and clarifications to the relay discovery process are also defined."];

Multi-Signer DNSSEC Models
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8901.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many enterprises today employ the service of multiple DNS providers to distribute their authoritative DNS service.  Deploying DNSSEC in such an environment may present some challenges, depending on the configuration and feature set in use.  In particular, when each DNS provider independently signs zone data with their own keys, additional key-management mechanisms are necessary.  This document presents deployment models that accommodate this scenario and describes these key-management requirements.  These models do not require any changes to the behavior of validating resolvers, nor do they impose the new key-management requirements on authoritative servers not involved in multi-signer configurations."];

Extended DNS Errors

Though created primarily to extend SERVFAIL to provide additional information about the cause of DNS and DNSSEC failures, the Extended DNS Errors option defined in this document allows all response types to contain extended error information.  Extended DNS Error information does not change the processing of RCODEs."];

Secret Key Transaction Authentication
for DNS (TSIG)
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8945.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a protocol for transaction-level authentication using shared secrets and one-way hashing. It can be used to authenticate dynamic updates to a DNS zone as coming from an approved client or to authenticate responses as coming from an approved name server. No recommendation is made here for distributing the shared secrets; it is expected that a network administrator will statically configure name servers and clients using some out-of-band mechanism. This document obsoletes RFCs 2845 and 4635."];
