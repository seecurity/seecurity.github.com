MIME-Based Secure Peer-to-Peer Business
Data Interchange Using HTTP,
Applicability Statement 2 (AS2)
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document provides an applicability statement (RFC 2026, Section 3.2) that describes how to exchange structured business data securely using the HTTP transfer protocol, instead of SMTP; the applicability statement for SMTP is found in RFC 3335.  Structured business data may be XML; Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in either the American National Standards Committee (ANSI) X12 format or the UN Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (UN/EDIFACT) format; or other structured data formats.  The data is packaged using standard MIME structures.  Authentication and data confidentiality are obtained by using Cryptographic Message Syntax with S/MIME security body parts.  Authenticated acknowledgements make use of multipart/signed Message Disposition Notification (MDN) responses to the original HTTP message.  This applicability statement is informally referred to as AS2 because it is the second applicability statement, produced after AS1, RFC 3335. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

These features are not necessarily supported by all EDIINT applications and could cause potential problems with implementations.  The EDIINT-Features header field provides a means to resolve these problems and support new functionality.

Multiple Attachments for Electronic Data
Interchange - Internet Integration
(EDIINT)
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6362.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Electronic Data Interchange - Internet Integration (EDIINT) AS1, AS2, and AS3 messages were designed specifically for the transport of EDI documents.  Since multiple interchanges could be placed within a single EDI document, there was not a need for sending multiple EDI documents in a single message.  As adoption of EDIINT grew, other uses developed aside from single EDI document transport.  Some transactions required multiple attachments to be interpreted together and stored in a single message.  This Informational RFC describes how multiple documents, including non-EDI payloads, can be attached and transmitted in a single EDIINT transport message.  The attachments are stored within the MIME multipart/related structure.  A minimal list of content-types to be supported as attachments is provided.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
