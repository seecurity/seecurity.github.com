MAC-Forced Forwarding: A Method for
Subscriber Separation on an Ethernet
Access Network
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism to ensure layer-2 separation of Local Area Network (LAN) stations accessing an IPv4 gateway over a bridged Ethernet segment. The mechanism - called MAC-Forced Forwarding - implements an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) proxy function that prohibits Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) address resolution between hosts located within the same IPv4 subnet but at different customer premises, and in effect directs all upstream traffic to an IPv4 gateway. The IPv4 gateway provides IP-layer connectivity between these same hosts. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
(VRRP)

VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router controlling the IP address(es) associated with a virtual router is called the Master, and forwards packets sent to these IP addresses.  The election process provides dynamic fail over in the forwarding responsibility should the Master become unavailable.  This allows any of the virtual router IP addresses on the LAN to be used as the default first hop router by end-hosts.  The advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher availability default path without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
