This document specifies procedures by which RSVP messages traveling from CE to CE across an L3VPN may be appropriately handled by PE routers so that admission control can be performed on PE-CE links.  Optionally, admission control across the provider's backbone may also be supported. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
