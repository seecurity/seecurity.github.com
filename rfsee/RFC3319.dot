Analysis on IPv6 Transition in Third

These networks are based on General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology, and the radio network architecture is based on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)/Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technology. The focus is on analyzing different transition scenarios and applicable transition mechanisms and finding solutions for those transition scenarios. In these scenarios, the User Equipment (UE) connects to other nodes, e.g., in the Internet, and IPv6/IPv4 transition mechanisms are needed. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

The framework provides a means to deliver profile data that user agents need to be functional, automatically and with minimal or no User and Administrative intervention.  The framework describes how SIP user agents can discover sources, request profiles, and receive notifications related to profile modifications.  As part of this framework, a new SIP event package is defined for notification of profile changes.  The framework provides minimal data retrieval options to ensure interoperability.  The framework does not include specification of the profile data within its scope. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
