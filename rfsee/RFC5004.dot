Avoid BGP Best Path Transitions from One

The proposed extension would help the overall network stability, and more importantly, would eliminate certain BGP route oscillations in which more than one external path from one BGP speaker contributes to the churn.

Segment Routing Prefix Segment
Identifier Extensions for BGP
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8669.html", target="_top", tooltip="Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source-routing paradigm. A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions called segments. A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service based. The ingress node prepends an SR header to a packet containing a set of segment identifiers (SIDs). Each SID represents a topological or service-based instruction. Per-flow state is maintained only on the ingress node of the SR domain. An SR domain is defined as a single administrative domain for global SID assignment. This document defines an optional, transitive BGP attribute for announcing information about BGP Prefix Segment Identifiers (BGP Prefix-SIDs) and the specification for SR-MPLS SIDs."];
