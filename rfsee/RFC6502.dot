A Framework for Centralized Conferencing

The framework allows participants using various call signaling protocols, such as SIP, H.323, Jabber, Q.931 or ISDN User Part (ISUP), to exchange media in a centralized unicast conference.  The Centralized Conferencing Framework defines logical entities and naming conventions.  The framework also outlines a set of conferencing protocols, which are complementary to the call signaling protocols, for building advanced conferencing applications.  The framework binds all the defined components together for the benefit of builders of conferencing systems. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

This information would allow a CCMP-enabled client that joins a conference using SIP to also register for the Centralized Conferencing (XCON) conference event package and take advantage of CCMP operations on the conference. This document describes two mechanisms, depending upon the need of the User Agent (UA), to address the above limitation.
