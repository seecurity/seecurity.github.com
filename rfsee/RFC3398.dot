Middlebox Communications (MIDCOM)
Protocol Semantics

The semantics discussion does not include any specification of a concrete syntax or a transport protocol.  However, a concrete protocol is expected to implement the specified semantics or, more likely, a superset of it.  The MIDCOM protocol semantics is derived from the MIDCOM requirements, from the MIDCOM framework, and from working group decisions.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Requirements for Management of Overload
in the Session Initiation Protocol
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5390.html", target="_top", tooltip="Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when proxies and user agents have insufficient resources to complete the processing of a request.  SIP provides limited support for overload handling through its 503 response code, which tells an upstream element that it is overloaded.  However, numerous problems have been identified with this mechanism.  This document summarizes the problems with the existing 503 mechanism, and provides some requirements for a solution.

Interworking ISDN Call Control User

As networks move to SIP, it is important that applications requiring this data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as have the ability to interwork with this ISDN service for end-to-end transparency. This document defines a usage (a new package called the ISDN UUI package) of the User-to-User header field to enable interworking with this ISDN service. This document covers interworking with both public ISDN and private ISDN capabilities, so the potential interworking with QSIG will also be addressed. The package is identified by the new value isdn-uui of the purpose header field parameter."];
