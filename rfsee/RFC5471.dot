Guidelines for IP Flow Information
Export (IPFIX) Testing

This document specifies guidelines for a series of tests that can be run on the IPFIX Exporting Process and Collecting Process in order to probe the conformity and robustness of the IPFIX protocol implementations.  These tests cover all important functions, in order to gain a level of confidence in the IPFIX implementation.  Therefore, they allow the implementer to perform interoperability or plug tests with other IPFIX Exporting Processes and Collecting Processes.
