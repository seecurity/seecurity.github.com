Mobile IPv4 Extension for Carrying
Network Access Identifiers
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="When a mobile node moves between two foreign networks, it has to be re-authenticated.  If the home network has both multiple Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers and Home Agents (HAs) in use, the Home AAA server may not have sufficient information to process the re-authentication correctly (i.e., to ensure that the same HA continues to be used).  This document defines a Mobile IP extension that carries identities for the Home AAA and HA servers in the form of Network Access Identifiers (NAIs).  The extension allows a Home Agent to pass its identity (and that of the Home AAA server) to the mobile node, which can then pass it on to the local AAA server when changing its point of attachment.  This extension may also be used in other situations requiring communication of a NAI between Mobile IP nodes.

Mobile IPv4 Regional Registration
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4857.html", target="_top", tooltip="Using Mobile IP, a mobile node registers with its home agent each time it changes care-of address.  This document describes a new kind of regional registrations, i.e., registrations local to the visited domain.  The regional registrations are performed via a new network entity called a Gateway Foreign Agent (GFA) and introduce a layer of hierarchy in the visited domain.  Regional registrations reduce the number of signaling messages to the home network, and reduce the signaling delay when a mobile node moves from one foreign agent to another within the same visited domain.  This document is an optional extension to the Mobile IPv4 protocol.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];
