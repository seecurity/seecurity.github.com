Non-interactive Emergency Calls
2020", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Use of the Internet for emergency calling is described in RFC 6443, 'Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia'.  In some cases of emergency calls, the transmission of application data is all that is needed, and no interactive media channel is established: a situation referred to as 'non-interactive emergency calls', where, unlike most emergency calls, there is no two-way interactive media such as voice or video or text.  This document describes use of a SIP MESSAGE transaction that includes a container for the data based on the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).  That type of emergency request does not establish a session, distinguishing it from SIP INVITE, which does.

RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time
Applications
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3550.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

Additional Data Related to an Emergency
Call
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7852.html", target="_top", tooltip="When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), the originating device, the access network provider to which the device is connected, and all service providers in the path of the call have information about the call, the caller, or the location, which is helpful for the PSAP to have in handling the emergency. This document describes data structures and mechanisms to convey such data to the PSAP. The intent is that every emergency call carry as much of the information described here as possible using the mechanisms described here. The mechanisms permit the data to be conveyed by reference (as an external resource) or by value (within the body of a SIP message or a location object). This follows the tradition of prior emergency services standardization work where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling (i.e., in the body of the SIP message) or by reference."];

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Extension for Instant Messaging
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3428.html", target="_top", tooltip="Instant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer of messages between users in near real-time.  These messages are usually, but not required to be, short.  IMs are often used in a conversational mode, that is, the transfer of messages back and forth is fast enough for participants to maintain an interactive conversation.  This document proposes the MESSAGE method, an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that allows the transfer of Instant Messages.  Since the MESSAGE request is an extension to SIP, it inherits all the request routing and security features of that protocol.  MESSAGE requests carry the content in the form of MIME body parts.  MESSAGE requests do not themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal usage each Instant Message stands alone, much like pager messages.  MESSAGE requests may be sent in the context of a dialog initiated by some other SIP request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
