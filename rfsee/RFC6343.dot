Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisement Problem
Statement
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6104.html", target="_top", tooltip="When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers are configured to send IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) to convey information to nodes that enable them to autoconfigure on the network.

However, unintended misconfigurations by users or administrators, or possibly malicious attacks on the network, may lead to bogus RAs being present, which in turn can cause operational problems for hosts on the network.  In this document, we summarise the scenarios in which rogue RAs may be observed and present a list of possible solutions to the problem.  We focus on the unintended causes of rogue RAs in the text.
