The answerer can either accept or reject the offer separately for each individual file.  The transfer of one or more files is initiated after a successful negotiation.

It extends the Common Policy authorization framework to provide location-specific access control.

Furthermore, this document defines two algorithms for reducing the granularity of returned location information. The first algorithm is defined for usage with civic location information, whereas the other one applies to geodetic location information. Both algorithms come with limitations. There are circumstances where the amount of location obfuscation provided is less than what is desired. These algorithms might not be appropriate for all application domains. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

MRCPv2 is not a stand-alone protocol -- it relies on other protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe, discover, and exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the media source or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above, allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the speech resource server.

Additional Data Related to an Emergency

This document describes data structures and mechanisms to convey such data to the PSAP. The intent is that every emergency call carry as much of the information described here as possible using the mechanisms described here. The mechanisms permit the data to be conveyed by reference (as an external resource) or by value (within the body of a SIP message or a location object). This follows the tradition of prior emergency services standardization work where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling (i.e., in the body of the SIP message) or by reference."];

Non-interactive Emergency Calls

In some cases of emergency calls, the transmission of application data is all that is needed, and no interactive media channel is established: a situation referred to as 'non-interactive emergency calls', where, unlike most emergency calls, there is no two-way interactive media such as voice or video or text.  This document describes use of a SIP MESSAGE transaction that includes a container for the data based on the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).  That type of emergency request does not establish a session, distinguishing it from SIP INVITE, which does.

Interoperability Profile for Relay User

The CA interprets using sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.  Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency, termed a provider in this document.  The provider also provides a video service that allows users to connect video devices to their service and subsequently to CAs and other sign language speakers.  It is desirable that the videophones used by the sign language speaker conform to a standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that direct video calls between sign language speakers work.  This document describes the interface between a videophone and a provider."];
