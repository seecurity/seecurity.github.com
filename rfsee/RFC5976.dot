QSPEC Template for the Quality-of-

The QSPEC parameters provide a common language to be reused in several QOSMs and thereby aim to ensure the extensibility and interoperability of QoS NSLP.

The node initiating the NSIS signaling adds an Initiator QSPEC, which indicates the QSPEC parameters that must be interpreted by the downstream nodes less the reservation fails, thereby ensuring the intention of the NSIS initiator is preserved along the signaling path.

Quality-of-Service Signaling

It is in accordance with the framework and requirements developed in NSIS.  Together with General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST), it provides functionality similar to RSVP and extends it.  The QoS NSLP is independent of the underlying QoS specification or architecture and provides support for different reservation models.  It is simplified by the elimination of support for multicast flows.  This specification explains the overall protocol approach, describes the design decisions made, and provides examples.  It specifies object, message formats, and processing rules.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.

Generic Connection Admission Control
(GCAC) Algorithm Specification for
IP/MPLS Networks
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6601.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents a generic connection admission control (GCAC) reference model and algorithm for IP-/MPLS-based networks.  Service provider (SP) IP/MPLS networks need an MPLS GCAC mechanism, as one motivational example, to reject Voice over IP (VoIP) calls when additional calls would adversely affect calls already in progress.  Without MPLS GCAC, connections on congested links will suffer degraded quality.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm can be optionally implemented in vendor equipment and deployed by service providers.  MPLS GCAC interoperates between vendor equipment and across multiple service provider domains.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm uses available standard mechanisms for MPLS-based networks, such as RSVP, Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE), Path Computation Element (PCE), Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS), Diffserv, and OSPF.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm does not include aspects of CAC that might be considered vendor proprietary implementations, such as detailed path selection mechanisms.  MPLS GCAC functions are implemented in a distributed manner to deliver the objective Quality of Service (QoS) for specified QoS constraints.  The objective is that the source is able to compute a source route with high likelihood that via-elements along the selected path will in fact admit the request.  In some cases (e.g., multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes)), this objective cannot always be met, but this document summarizes methods that partially meet this objective.  MPLS GCAC is applicable to any service or flow that must meet an objective QoS (delay, jitter, packet loss rate) for a specified quantity of traffic.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];
