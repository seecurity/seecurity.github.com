Considerations Section in RFCs
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8126.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters. To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry. This is the third edition of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226."];

MPLS-TP Shared-Ring Protection (MSRP)
Mechanism for Ring Topology
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8227.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes requirements, architecture, and solutions for MPLS-TP Shared-Ring Protection (MSRP) in a ring topology for point- to-point (P2P) services.  The MSRP mechanism is described to meet the ring protection requirements as described in RFC 5654.  This document defines the Ring Protection Switching (RPS) protocol that is used to coordinate the protection behavior of the nodes on an MPLS ring."];

Signaling Root-Initiated Point-to-
Multipoint Pseudowire Using LDP
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8338.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a mechanism to signal Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) trees using LDP.  Such a mechanism is suitable for any Layer 2 VPN service requiring P2MP connectivity over an IP or MPLS-enabled PSN.  A P2MP PW established via the proposed mechanism is root initiated.  This document updates RFC 7385 by reassigning the reserved value 0xFF to be the wildcard transport tunnel type."];

A YANG Network Data Model for Layer 2
VPNs
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9291.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines an L2VPN Network Model (L2NM) that can be used to manage the provisioning of Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN) services within a network (e.g., a service provider network). The L2NM complements the L2VPN Service Model (L2SM) by providing a network-centric view of the service that is internal to a service provider. The L2NM is particularly meant to be used by a network controller to derive the configuration information that will be sent to relevant network devices. Also, this document defines a YANG module to manage Ethernet segments and the initial versions of two IANA-maintained modules that include a set of identities of BGP Layer 2 encapsulation types and pseudowire types."];

IANA Registry and Processing
Recommendations for the First Nibble
Following a Label Stack
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9790.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document creates a new IANA registry (called the Post-Stack First Nibble registry) for the first nibble (4-bit field) immediately following an MPLS label stack. Furthermore, this document presents some requirements for registering new values and making the processing of MPLS packets easier and more robust. The relationship between the IANA Post-Stack First Nibble registry and the IP Version Numbers registry (RFC 2780) is described in this document. This document updates RFC 4928 by deprecating the heuristic method for identifying the type of packet encapsulated in MPLS."];
