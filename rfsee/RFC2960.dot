While Quick-Start is designed to be used by a range of transport protocols, in this document we only specify its use with TCP. Quick-Start is designed to allow connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers along the path approve the Quick-Start Request. This document describes many paths where Quick-Start Requests would not be approved. These paths include all paths containing routers, IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start. These paths also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing IP options. Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that include multi-access layer- two networks. This document also describes environments where the Quick-Start process could fail with false positives, with the sender incorrectly assuming that the Quick-Start Request had been approved by all of the routers along the path. As a result of these concerns, and as a result of the difficulties and seeming absence of motivation for routers, such as core routers to deploy Quick-Start, Quick-Start is being proposed as a mechanism that could be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet.

SCTP is designed to transport Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks, but is capable of broader applications. SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet network such as IP. It offers the following services to its users: -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data, -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size, -- sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages, -- optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association. The design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

IPv4 Reassembly Errors at High Data
Rates
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4963.html", target="_top", tooltip="IPv4 fragmentation is not sufficiently robust for use under some conditions in today's Internet.  At high data rates, the 16-bit IP identification field is not large enough to prevent frequent incorrectly assembled IP fragments, and the TCP and UDP checksums are insufficient to prevent the resulting corrupted datagrams from being delivered to higher protocol layers.  This note describes some easily reproduced experiments demonstrating the problem, and discusses some of the operational implications of these observations.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Specifying New Congestion Control
Algorithms
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5033.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks).  Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes that significantly differ from the IETF's congestion control principles.  Using these new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications to both the traffic using the new congestion control and to traffic using the currently standardized congestion control.  Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing with alternate congestion control proposals.  The goal of this document is to provide guidance for considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
