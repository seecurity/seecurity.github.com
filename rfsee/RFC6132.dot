Sieve: An Email Filtering Language

It is designed to be implementable on either a mail client or mail server.  It is meant to be extensible, simple, and independent of access protocol, mail architecture, and operating system.  It is suitable for running on a mail server where users may not be allowed to execute arbitrary programs, such as on black box Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) servers, as the base language has no variables, loops, or ability to shell out to external programs.

Most of these methods involve polling to check for new messages periodically.  A push method handled by the final delivery agent gives users quicker notifications and saves server resources.  This document does not specify the notification method, but it is expected that using existing instant messaging infrastructure such as Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), or Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) Short Message Service (SMS) messages will be popular.

This format defines a textual note, an indication of availability (open or closed) and a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for communication. The Rich Presence Information Data format (RPID) described here is an extension that adds optional elements to the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF). These extensions provide additional information about the presentity and its contacts. The information is designed so that much of it can be derived automatically, e.g., from calendar files or user activity. This extension includes information about what the person is doing, a grouping identifier for a tuple, when a service or device was last used, the type of place a person is in, what media communications might remain private, the relationship of a service tuple to another presentity, the person's mood, the time zone it is located in, the type of service it offers, an icon reflecting the presentity's status, and the overall role of the presentity.

Location Object (PIDF-LO) Usage
Clarification, Considerations, and

There are, however, circumstances that arise when information needs to be constrained in how it is represented.  In these circumstances, the range of options that need to be implemented are reduced.  There is growing interest in being able to use location information contained in a PIDF-LO for routing applications.  To allow successful interoperability between applications, location information needs to be normative and more tightly constrained than is currently specified in RFC 4119 (PIDF-LO).  This document makes recommendations on how to constrain, represent, and interpret locations in a PIDF-LO.  It further recommends a subset of Geography Markup Language (GML) 3.1.1 that is mandatory to implement by applications involved in location-based routing. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
