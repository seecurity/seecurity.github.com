Among other drawbacks, this cart-before-the-horse situation has made it difficult to determine whether DNSSEC meets its design goals, since its design goals are not well specified.  This note attempts to document some of the known threats to the DNS, and, in doing so, attempts to measure to what extent (if any) DNSSEC is a useful tool in defending against these threats.

The organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents.  A message can contain multiple signatures, from the same or different organizations involved with the message.  DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for email, using public key cryptography and using the domain name service as its key server technology.  This permits verification of a responsible organization, as well as the integrity of the message content.  DKIM will also provide a mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish information about their email signing practices; this will permit email receivers to make additional assessments about messages.  DKIM's authentication of email identity can assist in the global control of spam and phishing.  This document provides implementation, deployment, operational, and migration considerations for DKIM.

Assertion of responsibility is validated through a cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit from author to recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive change to the message content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.
