Unicast-Based Rapid Acquisition of

Depending on the join time, length of the Reference Information repetition (or appearance) interval, size of the Reference Information, and the application and transport properties, the time lag before an RTP receiver can usefully consume the multicast data, which we refer to as the Acquisition Delay, varies and can be large. This is an undesirable phenomenon for receivers that frequently switch among different multicast sessions, such as video broadcasts. In this document, we describe a method using the existing RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) machinery that reduces the acquisition delay. In this method, an auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying the Reference Information to the receiver precedes or accompanies the multicast stream. This unicast RTP flow can be transmitted at a faster than natural bitrate to further accelerate the acquisition. The motivating use case for this capability is multicast applications that carry real-time compressed audio and video.

Indicating Exclusive Support of RTP and
RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Multiplexing
Using the Session Description Protocol
(SDP)
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8858.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media-level attribute, 'rtcp-mux-only', that can be used by an endpoint to indicate exclusive support of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) multiplexing.  The document also updates RFC 5761 by clarifying that an offerer can use a mechanism to indicate that it is not able to send and receive RTCP on separate ports."];

Sending Multiple RTP Streams in a Single
RTP Session: Grouping RTP Control
Protocol (RTCP) Reception Statistics and
Other Feedback
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8861.html", target="_top", tooltip="RTP allows multiple RTP streams to be sent in a single session but requires each Synchronization Source (SSRC) to send RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) reception quality reports for every other SSRC visible in the session.  This causes the number of RTCP reception reports to grow with the number of SSRCs, rather than the number of endpoints.  In many cases, most of these RTCP reception reports are unnecessary, since all SSRCs of an endpoint are normally co-located and see the same reception quality.  This memo defines a Reporting Group extension to RTCP to reduce the reporting overhead in such scenarios."];

RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Feedback for
Congestion Control
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8888.html", target="_top", tooltip="An effective RTP congestion control algorithm requires more fine-grained feedback on packet loss, timing, and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marks than is provided by the standard RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR) packets.  This document describes an RTCP feedback message intended to enable congestion control for interactive real-time traffic using RTP.  The feedback message is designed for use with a sender-based congestion control algorithm, in which the receiver of an RTP flow sends back to the sender RTCP feedback packets containing the information the sender needs to perform congestion control."];

Negotiating Media Multiplexing Using the
Session Description Protocol (SDP)
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9143.html", target="_top", tooltip="This specification defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework extension called 'BUNDLE'. The extension can be used with the SDP offer/answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a single transport (5-tuple) for sending and receiving media described by multiple SDP media descriptions (m= sections). Such transport is referred to as a BUNDLE transport, and the media is referred to as bundled media. The m= sections that use the BUNDLE transport form a BUNDLE group. This specification defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Source Description (SDES) item and a new RTP header extension. This specification updates RFCs 3264, 5888, and 7941.

Completely Encrypting RTP Header
Extensions and Contributing Sources
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9335.html", target="_top", tooltip="While the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) provides confidentiality for the contents of a media packet, a significant amount of metadata is left unprotected, including RTP header extensions and contributing sources (CSRCs). However, this data can be moderately sensitive in many applications. While there have been previous attempts to protect this data, they have had limited deployment, due to complexity as well as technical limitations. This document updates RFC 3711, the SRTP specification, and defines Cryptex as a new mechanism that completely encrypts header extensions and CSRCs and uses simpler Session Description Protocol (SDP) signaling with the goal of facilitating deployment."];
