Evaluation of IPv6 Transition Mechanisms
for Unmanaged Networks
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document analyzes issues involved in the transition of unmanaged networks from IPv4 to IPv6.  Unmanaged networks typically correspond to home networks or small office networks.  A companion paper analyzes out the requirements for mechanisms needed in various transition scenarios of these networks to IPv6.  Starting from this analysis, we evaluate the suitability of mechanisms that have already been specified, proposed, or deployed.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through
Network Address Translations (NATs)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4380.html", target="_top", tooltip="We propose here a service that enables nodes located behind one or more IPv4 Network Address Translations (NATs) to obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling packets over UDP; we call this the Teredo service.  Running the service requires the help of Teredo servers and Teredo relays.  The Teredo servers are stateless, and only have to manage a small fraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the Teredo relays act as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the native IPv6 Internet.  The relays can also provide interoperability with hosts using other transition mechanisms such as 6to4. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

ISP IPv6 Deployment Scenarios in
Broadband Access Networks
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4779.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides a detailed description of IPv6 deployment and integration methods and scenarios in today\'s Service Provider (SP) Broadband (BB) networks in coexistence with deployed IPv4 services.  Cable/HFC, BB Ethernet, xDSL, and WLAN are the main BB technologies that are currently deployed, and discussed in this document.  The emerging Broadband Power Line Communications (PLC/BPL) access technology is also discussed for completeness.  In this document we will discuss main components of IPv6 BB networks, their differences from IPv4 BB networks, and how IPv6 is deployed and integrated in each of these networks using tunneling mechanisms and native IPv6.

IPv6 Tunnel Broker with the Tunnel Setup
Protocol (TSP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5572.html", target="_top", tooltip="A tunnel broker with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) enables the establishment of tunnels of various inner protocols, such as IPv6 or IPv4, inside various outer protocols packets, such as IPv4, IPv6, or UDP over IPv4 for IPv4 NAT traversal.  The control protocol (TSP) is used by the tunnel client to negotiate the tunnel with the broker.  A mobile node implementing TSP can be connected to both IPv4 and IPv6 networks whether it is on IPv4 only, IPv4 behind a NAT, or on IPv6 only.  A tunnel broker may terminate the tunnels on remote tunnel servers or on itself.  This document describes the TSP within the model of the tunnel broker model.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Routing and Addressing in Networks with

2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6139.html", target="_top", tooltip="Routing and Addressing in Networks with Global Enterprise Recursion (RANGER) (RFC 5720) provides an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing.  It provides an incrementally deployable approach for scalability, provider independence, mobility, multihoming, traffic engineering, and security.  This document describes a series of use cases in order to showcase the architectural capabilities.  It further shows how the RANGER architecture restores the network-within-network principles originally intended for the sustained growth of the Internet.
