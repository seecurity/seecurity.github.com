Explicit Tracking with Wildcard Routes
in Multicast VPN
2019", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The base Multicast VPN (MVPN) specifications (RFCs 6513 and 6514) provide procedures to allow a multicast ingress node to invoke explicit tracking for a multicast flow or set of flows, thus learning the egress nodes for that flow or set of flows.  However, the specifications are not completely clear about how the explicit tracking procedures work in certain scenarios.  This document provides the necessary clarifications.  It also specifies a new, optimized explicit-tracking procedure.  This new procedure allows an ingress node, by sending a single message, to request explicit tracking of each of a set of flows, where the set of flows is specified using a wildcard mechanism.

IPv4 and IPv6 Infrastructure Addresses

2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6515.html", target="_top", tooltip="To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) service, Provider Edge routers originate BGP Update messages that carry Multicast-VPN (MCAST-VPN) BGP routes; they also originate unicast VPN routes that carry MVPN-specific attributes.

These two address spaces are independent, and the address family (IPv4 or IPv6) of the two spaces may or may not be the same.  These routes always contain an address family field that specifies whether the customer addresses are IPv4 addresses or whether they are IPv6 addresses.  However, there is no field that explicitly specifies the address family of the provider addresses.  To ensure interoperability, this document specifies that provider IPv4 addresses are always encoded in these update messages as 4-octet addresses, and that the distinction between IPv4 and IPv6 is signaled solely by the length of the address field.
