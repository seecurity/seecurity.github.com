Using International Standard Book

Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace
Registration Transition

That requirement discouraged some registrations and increased the risk for problems that could occur as a result.  The requirements have now been changed by RFC 8141, which adopts a different model, focusing on encouraging registration and publication of information for all appropriate namespaces.  This document clarifies the status of relevant older RFCs and confirms and documents advice to IANA about selected existing registrations.  This document also obsoletes RFCs 3044 and 3187 and moves them to Historic status.  These RFCs describe the ISSN and ISBN namespaces, which are now outdated because the descriptions reside in registration templates."];

URNs for the Alert-Info Header Field of
the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7462.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to provide a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the User Agent (UA) as an alerting signal (e.g., a ring tone or ringback tone) when the user is alerted. This is done using the Alert-Info header field. However, the reference (typically a URL) addresses only a specific network resource with specific rendering properties. There is currently no support for standard identifiers for describing the semantics of the alerting situation or the characteristics of the alerting signal, without being tied to a particular rendering. To overcome these limitations and support new applications, a new family of URNs for use in Alert-Info header fields (and situations with similar requirements) is defined in this specification. This document normatively updates RFC 3261, which defines the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). It changes the usage of the Alert-Info header field defined in RFC 3261 by additionally allowing its use in any non-100 provisional response to INVITE. This document also permits proxies to add or remove an Alert-Info header field and to add or remove Alert-Info header field values."];

Uniform Resource Names (URNs)

With regard to URN syntax, this document defines the canonical syntax for URNs (in a way that is consistent with URI syntax), specifies methods for determining URN-equivalence, and discusses URI conformance.  With regard to URN namespaces, this document specifies a method for defining a URN namespace and associating it with a namespace identifier, and it describes procedures for registering namespace identifiers with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  This document obsoletes both RFCs 2141 and 3406."];

Using National Bibliography Numbers as
Uniform Resource Names

NBNs are usually applied to resources that are not catered for by established (standard) identifier systems such as International Standard Book Number (ISBN). A Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for NBNs was established in 2001 in RFC 3188. Since then, a number of European national libraries have implemented URN:NBN-based systems.
