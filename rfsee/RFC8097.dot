BGP Prefix Origin Validation
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6811.html", target="_top", tooltip="To help reduce well-known threats against BGP including prefix mis- announcing and monkey-in-the-middle attacks, one of the security requirements is the ability to validate the origination Autonomous System (AS) of BGP routes.  More specifically, one needs to validate that the AS number claiming to originate an address prefix (as derived from the AS_PATH attribute of the BGP route) is in fact authorized by the prefix holder to do so.  This document describes a simple validation mechanism to partially satisfy this requirement. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Revised Error Handling for BGP UPDATE
Messages
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7606.html", target="_top", tooltip="According to the base BGP specification, a BGP speaker that receives an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is required to reset the session over which the offending attribute was received. This behavior is undesirable because a session reset would impact not only routes with the offending attribute but also other valid routes exchanged over the session. This document partially revises the error handling for UPDATE messages and provides guidelines for the authors of documents defining new attributes. Finally, it revises the error handling procedures for a number of existing attributes. This document updates error handling for RFCs 1997, 4271, 4360, 4456, 4760, 5543, 5701, and 6368."];
