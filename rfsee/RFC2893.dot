The Generalized TTL Security Mechanism
(GTSM)
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3682.html", target="_top", tooltip="The use of a packet's Time to Live (TTL) (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6) to protect a protocol stack from CPU-utilization based attacks has been proposed in many settings (see for example, RFC 2461).  This document generalizes these techniques for use by other protocols such as BGP (RFC 1771), Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP), Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, and Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) (RFC 3036).  While the Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM) is most effective in protecting directly connected protocol peers, it can also provide a lower level of protection to multi-hop sessions.  GTSM is not directly applicable to protocols employing flooding mechanisms (e.g., multicast), and use of multi-hop GTSM should be considered on a case-by-case basis.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Likewise, extension MIB modules may be designed for managing security-specific objects.  This MIB module does not support tunnels over non-IP networks.
