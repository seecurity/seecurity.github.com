Voice Messaging Directory Service

The service provides the email address of the recipient that is given a telephone number. It optionally provides the spoken name of the recipient and the media capabilities of the recipient. The VPIM directory Schema provides essential additional attributes to recreate the voice mail user experience using standardized directories. This user experience provides, at the time of addressing, basic assurances that the message will be delivered as intended. This document combines two earlier documents, one from Anne Brown and one from Greg Vaudreuil, that define a voice messaging schema into a single working group submission.
