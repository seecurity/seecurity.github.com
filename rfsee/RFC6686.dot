Resolution of the Sender Policy
Framework (SPF) and Sender ID
Experiments
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In 2006, the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Sender ID: two proposed email authentication protocols. Both of these protocols enable one to publish, via the Domain Name System, a policy declaring which mail servers were authorized to send email on behalf of the domain name being queried. There was concern that the two would conflict in some significant operational situations, interfering with message delivery. The IESG required all of these documents (RFC 4405, RFC 4406, RFC 4407, and RFC 4408) to be published as Experimental RFCs and requested that the community observe deployment and operation of the protocols over a period of two years from the date of publication to determine a reasonable path forward. After six years, sufficient experience and evidence have been collected that the experiments thus created can be considered concluded. This document presents those findings. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

In particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending host can use as the MAIL FROM of a message or the domain given on the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands. This document describes version 1 of the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol, whereby ADministrative Management Domains (ADMDs) can explicitly authorize the hosts that are allowed to use their domain names, and a receiving host can check such authorization.
