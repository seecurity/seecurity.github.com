Mobile IPv4 Regional Registration

This document describes a new kind of regional registrations, i.e., registrations local to the visited domain.  The regional registrations are performed via a new network entity called a Gateway Foreign Agent (GFA) and introduce a layer of hierarchy in the visited domain.  Regional registrations reduce the number of signaling messages to the home network, and reduce the signaling delay when a mobile node moves from one foreign agent to another within the same visited domain.  This document is an optional extension to the Mobile IPv4 protocol.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Diameter Mobile IPv6: Support for

Interaction
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5447.html", target="_top", tooltip="A Mobile IPv6 node requires a home agent address, a home address, and a security association with its home agent before it can start utilizing Mobile IPv6.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these parameters be statically configured.  Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping work aims to make this information dynamically available to the mobile node.  An important aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution is to support interworking with existing Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) infrastructures.
