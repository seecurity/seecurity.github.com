Reflections on Internet Transparency

Far from having lessened in relevance, technical implications of intentionally or inadvertently impeding network transparency play a critical role in the Internet's ability to support innovation and global communication.  This document provides some specific illustrations of those potential impacts.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Survey of Proposed Use Cases for the
IPv6 Flow Label

This paper describes the flow label standard and discusses the implementation issues that it raises.  It then describes various published proposals for using the flow label and shows that most of them are inconsistent with the standard.  Methods to address this problem are briefly reviewed.  We also question whether the standard should be revised.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Considerations for Transitioning Content

While this is tailored to address end-user content, which is typically web-based, many aspects of this document may be more broadly applicable to the transition to IPv6 of other applications and services.  This document explores the challenges involved in the transition to IPv6, potential migration tactics, possible migration phases, and other considerations.
