Routing Extensions for Discovery of
Multiprotocol (MPLS) Label Switch Router
(LSR) Traffic Engineering (TE) Mesh
Membership
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4972.html", target="_top", tooltip="The setup of a full mesh of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSP) among a set of Label Switch Routers (LSR) is a common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic Engineering either for bandwidth optimization, bandwidth guarantees or fast rerouting with MPLS Fast Reroute.  Such deployment may require the configuration of a potentially large number of TE LSPs (on the order of the square of the number of LSRs).  This document specifies Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) so as to provide an automatic discovery of the set of LSRs members of a mesh in order to automate the creation of such mesh of TE LSPs.

OSPF Protocol Extensions for Path
Computation Element (PCE) Discovery

When the PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating passively in the IGP, a simple and efficient way to announce PCEs consists of using IGP flooding.  For that purpose, this document defines extensions to the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol for the advertisement of PCE Discovery information within an OSPF area or within the entire OSPF routing domain.
