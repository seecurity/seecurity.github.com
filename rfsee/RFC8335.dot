PROBE: A Utility for Probing Interfaces
2018", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a network diagnostic tool called PROBE.  PROBE is similar to PING in that it can be used to query the status of a probed interface, but it differs from PING in that it does not require bidirectional connectivity between the probing and probed interfaces.  Instead, PROBE requires bidirectional connectivity between the probing interface and a proxy interface.  The proxy interface can reside on the same node as the probed interface, or it can reside on a node to which the probed interface is directly connected.  This document updates RFC 4884."];

Extended ICMP to Support Multi-Part
Messages
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4884.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document redefines selected ICMP messages to support multi-part operation. A multi-part ICMP message carries all of the information that ICMP messages carried previously, as well as additional information that applications may require. Multi-part messages are supported by an ICMP extension structure. The extension structure is situated at the end of the ICMP message. It includes an extension header followed by one or more extension objects. Each extension object contains an object header and object payload. All object headers share a common format. This document further redefines the above mentioned ICMP messages by specifying a length attribute. All of the currently defined ICMP messages to which an extension structure can be appended include an original datagram field. The original datagram field contains the initial octets of the datagram that elicited the ICMP error message. Although the original datagram field is of variable length, the ICMP message does not include a field that specifies its length. Therefore, in order to facilitate message parsing, this document allocates eight previously reserved bits to reflect the length of the original datagram field. The proposed modifications change the requirements for ICMP compliance. The impact of these changes on compliant implementations is discussed, and new requirements for future implementations are presented. This memo updates RFC 792 and RFC 4443. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
