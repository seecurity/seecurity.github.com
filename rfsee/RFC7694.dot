Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Client-Initiated Content-Encoding
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In HTTP, content codings allow for payload encodings such as for compression or integrity checks. In particular, the gzip content coding is widely used for payload data sent in response messages. Content codings can be used in request messages as well; however, discoverability is not on par with response messages. This document extends the HTTP Accept-Encoding header field for use in responses, to indicate the content codings that are supported in requests."];
