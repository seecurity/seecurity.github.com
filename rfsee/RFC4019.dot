Corrections and Clarifications to RFC

Some parts of the specification are unclear or contain errors that may lead to misinterpretations that may impair interoperability between different implementations.  This document provides corrections, additions, and clarifications to RFC 3095; this document thus updates RFC 3095.  In addition, other clarifications related to RFC 3241 (ROHC over PPP), RFC 3843 (ROHC IP profile) and RFC 4109 (ROHC UDP-Lite profiles) are also provided. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

RObust Header Compression Version 2
(ROHCv2): Profiles for RTP, UDP, IP, ESP
and UDP-Lite
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5225.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profiles that efficiently compress RTP/UDP/IP (Real-Time Transport Protocol, User Datagram Protocol, Internet Protocol), RTP/UDP-Lite/IP (User Datagram Protocol Lite), UDP/IP, UDP-Lite/IP, IP and ESP/IP (Encapsulating Security Payload) headers. This specification defines a second version of the profiles found in RFC 3095, RFC 3843 and RFC 4019; it supersedes their definition, but does not obsolete them. The ROHCv2 profiles introduce a number of simplifications to the rules and algorithms that govern the behavior of the compression endpoints. It also defines robustness mechanisms that may be used by a compressor implementation to increase the probability of decompression success when packets can be lost and/or reordered on the ROHC channel. Finally, the ROHCv2 profiles define their own specific set of header formats, using the ROHC formal notation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
