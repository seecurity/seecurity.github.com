Report from the IETF Workshop on Peer-
to-Peer (P2P) Infrastructure, May 28,
2008
2009", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document reports the outcome of a workshop organized by the Real-time Applications and Infrastructure Area Directors of the IETF to discuss network delay and congestion issues resulting from increased Peer-to-Peer (P2P) traffic volumes.  The workshop was held on May 28, 2008 at MIT in Cambridge, MA, USA.  The goals of the workshop were twofold: to understand the technical problems that ISPs and end users are experiencing as a result of high volumes of P2P traffic, and to begin to understand how the IETF may be helpful in addressing these problems.  Gaining an understanding of where in the IETF this work might be pursued and how to extract feasible work items were highlighted as important tasks in pursuit of the latter goal.  The workshop was very well attended and produced several work items that have since been taken up by members of the IETF community.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

A Survey on Research on the Application-

Problem
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6029.html", target="_top", tooltip="A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used originally for file sharing, and more recently for real-time communications and live media streaming.  Such applications discover a route to each other through an overlay network with little knowledge of the underlying network topology.  As a result, they may choose peers based on information deduced from empirical measurements, which can lead to suboptimal choices.  This document, a product of the P2P Research Group, presents a survey of existing literature on discovering and using network topology information for Application-Layer Traffic Optimization.

Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
(ALTO) Deployment Considerations

This includes, but is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource.  This memo discusses deployment-related issues of ALTO.  It addresses different use cases of ALTO such as peer-to-peer file sharing and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and presents corresponding examples.  The document also includes recommendations for network administrators and application designers planning to deploy ALTO, such as recommendations on how to generate ALTO map information."];
