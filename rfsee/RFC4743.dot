Using NETCONF over the Simple Object

2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) is applicable to a wide range of devices in a variety of environments.  Web Services is one such environment and is presently characterized by the use of the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).  NETCONF finds many benefits in this environment: from the reuse of existing standards, to ease of software development, to integration with deployed systems.  Herein, we describe SOAP over HTTP and SOAP over Blocks Exchange Extensible Protocol (BEEP) bindings for NETCONF.

Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8996.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document formally deprecates Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346). Accordingly, those documents have been moved to Historic status. These versions lack support for current and recommended cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms, and various government and industry profiles of applications using TLS now mandate avoiding these old TLS versions. TLS version 1.2 became the recommended version for IETF protocols in 2008 (subsequently being obsoleted by TLS version 1.3 in 2018), providing sufficient time to transition away from older versions. Removing support for older versions from implementations reduces the attack surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines library and product maintenance. This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC 4347) but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1. This document updates many RFCs that normatively refer to TLS version 1.0 or TLS version 1.1, as described herein. This document also updates the best practices for TLS usage in RFC 7525; hence, it is part of BCP 195."];

Experience of Implementing NETCONF over
SOAP
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5381.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes how the authors developed a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)-based NETCONF (Network Configuration Protocol) client and server.  It describes an alternative SOAP binding for NETCONF that does not interoperate with an RFC 4743 conformant implementation making use of cookies on top of the persistent transport connections of HTTP.  When SOAP is used as a transport protocol for NETCONF, various kinds of development tools are available.  By making full use of these tools, developers can significantly reduce their workload.  The authors developed an NMS (Network Management System) and network equipment that can deal with NETCONF messages sent over SOAP.  This document aims to provide NETCONF development guidelines gained from the experience of implementing a SOAP-based NETCONF client and server.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
