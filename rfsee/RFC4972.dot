Routing Extensions for Discovery of
Multiprotocol (MPLS) Label Switch Router
(LSR) Traffic Engineering (TE) Mesh
Membership
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The setup of a full mesh of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSP) among a set of Label Switch Routers (LSR) is a common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic Engineering either for bandwidth optimization, bandwidth guarantees or fast rerouting with MPLS Fast Reroute.  Such deployment may require the configuration of a potentially large number of TE LSPs (on the order of the square of the number of LSRs).  This document specifies Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) so as to provide an automatic discovery of the set of LSRs members of a mesh in order to automate the creation of such mesh of TE LSPs.

Extensions to OSPF for Advertising
Optional Router Capabilities
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4970.html", target="_top", tooltip="It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to know the capabilities of their neighbors and other routers in the routing domain.  This document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 for advertising optional router capabilities.  A new Router Information (RI) Link State Advertisement (LSA) is proposed for this purpose.  In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented with a new opaque LSA type ID.  In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented with a new LSA type function code.  In both protocols, the RI LSA can be advertised at any of the defined flooding scopes (link, area, or autonomous system (AS)). [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Requirements for GMPLS-Based Multi-

2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5212.html", target="_top", tooltip="Most of the initial efforts to utilize Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been related to environments hosting devices with a single switching capability. The complexity raised by the control of such data planes is similar to that seen in classical IP/MPLS networks. By extending MPLS to support multiple switching technologies, GMPLS provides a comprehensive framework for the control of a multi-layered network of either a single switching technology or multiple switching technologies. In GMPLS, a switching technology domain defines a region, and a network of multiple switching types is referred to in this document as a multi-region network (MRN). When referring in general to a layered network, which may consist of either single or multiple regions, this document uses the term multi-layer network (MLN). This document defines a framework for GMPLS based multi-region / multi-layer networks and lists a set of functional requirements. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

As providers plan to grow these networks, they need to understand whether existing protocols and implementations can support the network sizes that they are planning. This document presents an analysis of some of the scaling concerns for the number of Label Switching Paths (LSPs) in MPLS-TE core networks, and examines the value of two techniques (LSP hierarchies and multipoint-to-point LSPs) for improving scaling. The intention is to motivate the development of appropriate deployment techniques and protocol extensions to enable the application of MPLS-TE in large networks. This document only considers the question of achieving scalability for the support of point-to-point MPLS-TE LSPs. Point-to-multipoint MPLS-TE LSPs are for future study.
