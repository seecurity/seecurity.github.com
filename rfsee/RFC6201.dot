Device Reset Characterization

Since there may be an interruption in the forwarding operation during a reset, it is useful to know how long a device takes to resume the forwarding operation. This document specifies a methodology for characterizing reset (and reset time) during benchmarking of forwarding devices and provides clarity and consistency in reset test procedures beyond what is specified in RFC 2544. Therefore, it updates RFC 2544. This document also defines the benchmarking term reset time and, only in this, updates RFC 1242.
