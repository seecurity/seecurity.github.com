Statement

This memo presents a list, intended to be comprehensive, of the problems that have since been identified. In addition, it reviews the history of domain names and summarizes current IETF publications and some publications from other organizations relating to Special-Use Domain Names. This document should be considered required reading for IETF participants who wish to express an informed opinion on the topic of Special-Use Domain Names."];

DNS Terminology

The terminology used by implementers and developers of DNS protocols, and by operators of DNS systems, has sometimes changed in the decades since the DNS was first defined. This document gives current definitions for many of the terms used in the DNS in a single document. This document obsoletes RFC 7719 and updates RFC 2308."];

Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8198.html", target="_top", tooltip="The DNS relies upon caching to scale; however, the cache lookup generally requires an exact match. This document specifies the use of NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to allow DNSSEC-validating resolvers to generate negative answers within a range and positive answers from wildcards. This increases performance, decreases latency, decreases resource utilization on both authoritative and recursive servers, and increases privacy. Also, it may help increase resilience to certain DoS attacks in some circumstances. This document updates RFC 4035 by allowing validating resolvers to generate negative answers based upon NSEC/NSEC3 records and positive answers in the presence of wildcards."];

The GNU Name System

GNS is a decentralized and censorship-resistant domain name resolution protocol that provides a privacy-enhancing alternative to the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. This document defines the normative wire format of resource records, resolution processes, cryptographic routines, and security and privacy considerations for use by implementers. This specification was developed outside the IETF and does not have IETF consensus. It is published here to inform readers about the function of GNS, guide future GNS implementations, and ensure interoperability among implementations (for example, pre-existing GNUnet implementations)."];

Best Practices for Deletion of Domain

Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9874.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) includes commands for clients to delete domain and host objects, both of which are used to publish information in the Domain Name System (DNS).  EPP also includes guidance for deletions that is intended to avoid DNS resolution disruptions and maintain data consistency.  However, operational relationships between objects can make that guidance difficult to implement.  Some EPP clients have developed operational practices to delete those objects that have unintended impacts on DNS resolution and security.  This document describes best current practices and proposes new potential practices to delete domain and host objects that reduce the risk of DNS resolution failure and maintain client-server data consistency."];
