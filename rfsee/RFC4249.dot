Message Disposition Notification

This content-type is intended to be machine-processable.  Additional message headers are also defined to permit Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender of a message.  The purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary LAN-based systems, and often referred to as read receipts, acknowledgements, or receipt notifications. The intention is to do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past.  Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary LAN-based systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of foreign addresses, in addition to those normally used in Internet Mail.  Additional attributes may also be defined to support tunneling of foreign notifications through Internet Mail. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier.

This document recommends that when writing IANA Considerations sections, authors should consider assigning a small range of numbers for experimentation purposes that implementers can use when testing protocol extensions or other new features.
