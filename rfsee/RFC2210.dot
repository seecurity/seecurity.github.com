Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
Proxy Approaches
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5945.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) can be used to make end-to- end resource reservations in an IP network in order to guarantee the quality of service required by certain flows.  RSVP assumes that both the data sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling.  Yet, there are use cases where resource reservation is required, but the receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable.  This document presents RSVP proxy behaviors allowing RSVP routers to initiate or terminate RSVP signaling on behalf of a receiver or a sender that is not RSVP-capable.  This allows resource reservations to be established on a critical subset of the end-to-end path.  This document reviews conceptual approaches for deploying RSVP proxies and discusses how RSVP reservations can be synchronized with application requirements, despite the sender, receiver, or both not participating in RSVP.  This document also points out where extensions to RSVP (or to other protocols) may be needed for deployment of a given RSVP proxy approach.

The QSPEC parameters provide a common language to be reused in several QOSMs and thereby aim to ensure the extensibility and interoperability of QoS NSLP.  While the base protocol is QOSM-agnostic, the parameters that can be carried in the QSPEC object are possibly closely coupled to specific models.  The node initiating the NSIS signaling adds an Initiator QSPEC, which indicates the QSPEC parameters that must be interpreted by the downstream nodes less the reservation fails, thereby ensuring the intention of the NSIS initiator is preserved along the signaling path.
