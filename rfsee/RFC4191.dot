There are many different approaches to address Distributed Mobility Management -- for example, extending network-based mobility protocols (like Proxy Mobile IPv6) or client-based mobility protocols (like Mobile IPv6), among others. This document follows the former approach and proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6, in which mobility sessions are anchored at the last IP hop router (called the mobility anchor and access router). The mobility anchor and access router is an enhanced access router that is also able to operate as a local mobility anchor or mobility access gateway on a per-prefix basis. The document focuses on the required extensions to effectively support the simultaneous anchoring several flows at different distributed gateways."];

An Autonomic Control Plane (ACP)
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8994.html", target="_top", tooltip="Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which depends on some addressing and routing.  This Autonomic Control Plane should ideally be self-managing and be as independent as possible of configuration.  This document defines such a plane and calls it the Autonomic Control Plane, with the primary use as a control plane for autonomic functions.  It also serves as a virtual out-of-band channel for Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) communications over a network that provides automatically configured, hop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via automatically configured IPv6 even when the network is not configured or is misconfigured."];
