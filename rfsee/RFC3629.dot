Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9639.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) format and its streamable subset.  FLAC is designed to reduce the amount of computer storage space needed to store digital audio signals.  It does this losslessly, i.e., it does so without losing information.  FLAC is free in the sense that its specification is open and its reference implementation is open source.  Compared to other lossless audio coding formats, FLAC is a format with low complexity and can be encoded and decoded with little computing resources.  Decoding of FLAC has been implemented independently for many different platforms, and both encoding and decoding can be implemented without needing floating-point arithmetic."];

A Profile for Resource Public Key

A TAK object can be used by a TA to signal to RPs the location(s) of the accompanying CA certificate for the current public key, as well as the successor public key and the location(s) of its CA certificate.  This object helps to support planned key rollovers without impacting RPKI validation."];

As specified in this document, the method allows clients and resource servers (RSs) to access a Token Revocation List (TRL) on the authorization server by using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), with the possible additional use of resource observation.  Resulting (unsolicited) notifications of revoked access tokens complement alternative approaches such as token introspection, while not requiring additional endpoints on clients and RSs."];
