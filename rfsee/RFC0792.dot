Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure
1985", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC0950.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo discusses the utility of subnets of Internet networks, which are logically visible sub-sections of a single Internet network.  For administrative or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to divide one Internet network into several subnets, instead of acquiring a set of Internet network numbers.  This memo specifies procedures for the use of subnets.  These procedures are for hosts (e.g., workstations).  The procedures used in and between subnet gateways are not fully described.  Important motivation and background information for a subnetting standard is provided in RFC-940.  This RFC specifies a protocol for the ARPA-Internet community.  If subnetting is implemented it is strongly recommended that these procedures be followed."];

Extended ICMP to Support Multi-Part
Messages
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4884.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document redefines selected ICMP messages to support multi-part operation. A multi-part ICMP message carries all of the information that ICMP messages carried previously, as well as additional information that applications may require. Multi-part messages are supported by an ICMP extension structure. The extension structure is situated at the end of the ICMP message. It includes an extension header followed by one or more extension objects. Each extension object contains an object header and object payload. All object headers share a common format. This document further redefines the above mentioned ICMP messages by specifying a length attribute. All of the currently defined ICMP messages to which an extension structure can be appended include an original datagram field. The original datagram field contains the initial octets of the datagram that elicited the ICMP error message. Although the original datagram field is of variable length, the ICMP message does not include a field that specifies its length. Therefore, in order to facilitate message parsing, this document allocates eight previously reserved bits to reflect the length of the original datagram field. The proposed modifications change the requirements for ICMP compliance. The impact of these changes on compliant implementations is discussed, and new requirements for future implementations are presented. This memo updates RFC 792 and RFC 4443. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
