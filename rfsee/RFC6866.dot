Evolution of the IP Model

The discussion of these properties is organized around evaluating a set of claims, or misconceptions.  Finally, this document provides some guidance to protocol designers and implementers.

It uses IPv6's intrinsic ability to assign multiple addresses to a network interface to provide continuity of network service through a make-before-break transition, as well as addresses naming and configuration management issues.  It also uses other IPv6 features to minimize the effort and time required to complete the transition from the old prefix to the new prefix.

Multicast DNS
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6762.html", target="_top", tooltip="As networked devices become smaller, more portable, and more ubiquitous, the ability to operate with less configured infrastructure is increasingly important. In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including, but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server is useful. Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server. In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use, without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names. The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work when no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure failures."];

The overall problem for many administrators will be to offer Internet- facing services over IPv6 while continuing to support IPv4, and while introducing IPv6 access within the enterprise IT network.  The overall transition will take most networks from an IPv4-only environment to a dual-stack network environment and eventually an IPv6-only operating mode.
