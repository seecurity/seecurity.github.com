Transfer Part 3 (MTP3) - User Adaptation

2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4666.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7 MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol.  Also, provision is made for protocol elements that enable a seamless operation of the MTP3-User peers in the SS7 and IP domains.  This protocol would be used between a Signalling Gateway (SG) and a Media Gateway Controller (MGC) or IP-resident Database, or between two IP-based applications.  It is assumed that the SG receives SS7 signalling over a standard SS7 interface using the SS7 Message Transfer Part (MTP) to provide transport.  This document obsoletes RFC 3332. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
