Exchanging cached <mapping> elements, i.e., non-authoritative elements, is possible but not envisioned.

The intent is that every emergency call carry as much of the information described here as possible using the mechanisms described here. The mechanisms permit the data to be conveyed by reference (as an external resource) or by value (within the body of a SIP message or a location object).
