Actions Addressing Identified Issues

(SIP) Non-INVITE Transaction

These modifications reduce the probability of messages losing the race condition inherent in the non-INVITE transaction and reduce useless network traffic.  They also improve the robustness of SIP networks when elements stop responding.  These changes update behavior defined in RFC 3261. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

It lists a current snapshot of the specifications under the SIP umbrella, briefly summarizes each, and groups them into categories.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Terminology for Benchmarking Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) Devices: Basic
Session Setup and Registration
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7501.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides a terminology for benchmarking the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance of devices.  Methodology related to benchmarking SIP devices is described in the companion methodology document (RFC 7502).  Using these two documents, benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different types of devices such as SIP Proxy Servers, Registrars, and Session Border Controllers.  The term performance in this context means the capacity of the Device Under Test (DUT) to process SIP messages.  Media streams are used only to study how they impact the signaling behavior.  The intent of the two documents is to provide a normalized set of tests that will enable an objective comparison of the capacity of SIP devices.  Test setup parameters and a methodology are necessary because SIP allows a wide range of configurations and operational conditions that can influence performance benchmark measurements.  A standard terminology and methodology will ensure that benchmarks have consistent definitions and were obtained following the same procedures."];

The document defines new SIP URI parameters to exchange PNS information between the UA and the SIP entity that will then request that push notifications be sent to the UA.  It also defines the parameters to trigger such push notification requests.  The document also defines new feature-capability indicators that can be used to indicate support of this mechanism."];
