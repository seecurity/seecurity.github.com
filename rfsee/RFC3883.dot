Detecting Inactive Neighbors over OSPF
Demand Circuits (DC)
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks.  OSPF behavior over demand circuits (DC) is optimized in RFC 1793 to minimize the amount of overhead traffic.  A part of the OSPF demand circuit extensions is the Hello suppression mechanism.  This technique allows a demand circuit to go down when no interesting traffic is going through the link.  However, it also introduces a problem, where it becomes impossible to detect an OSPF-inactive neighbor over such a link.  This memo introduces a new mechanism called neighbor probing to address the above problem. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
