Transport Protocol Path Signals
2019", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document discusses the nature of signals seen by on-path elements examining transport protocols, contrasting implicit and explicit signals.  For example, TCP's state machine uses a series of well-known messages that are exchanged in the clear.  Because these are visible to network elements on the path between the two nodes setting up the transport connection, they are often used as signals by those network elements.  In transports that do not exchange these messages in the clear, on-path network elements lack those signals.  Often, the removal of those signals is intended by those moving the messages to confidential channels.  Where the endpoints desire that network elements along the path receive these signals, this document recommends explicit signals be used.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Architectural Principles of the Internet

Considerations around Transport Header
Confidentiality, Network Operations, and
the Evolution of Internet Transport
Protocols
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9065.html", target="_top", tooltip="To protect user data and privacy, Internet transport protocols have supported payload encryption and authentication for some time. Such encryption and authentication are now also starting to be applied to the transport protocol headers. This helps avoid transport protocol ossification by middleboxes, mitigate attacks against the transport protocol, and protect metadata about the communication. Current operational practice in some networks inspect transport header information within the network, but this is no longer possible when those transport headers are encrypted. This document discusses the possible impact when network traffic uses a protocol with an encrypted transport header. It suggests issues to consider when designing new transport protocols or features."];

Current Open Questions in Path-Aware
Networking
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9217.html", target="_top", tooltip="In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware internetworking architecture has two important properties: it exposes the properties of available Internet paths to endpoints, and it provides for endpoints and applications to use these properties to select paths through the Internet for their traffic. While this property of path awareness already exists in many Internet-connected networks within single domains and via administrative interfaces to the network layer, a fully path-aware internetwork expands these concepts across layers and across the Internet. This document poses questions in path-aware networking, open as of 2021, that must be answered in the design, development, and deployment of path-aware internetworks. It was originally written to frame discussions in the Path Aware Networking Research Group (PANRG), and has been published to snapshot current thinking in this space."];

RFC 8558 describes path signals as messages to or from on-path elements and points out that visible information will be used whether or not it is intended as a signal.  The principles in this document are intended as guidance for the design of explicit path signals, which are encouraged to be authenticated and include a minimal set of parties to minimize information sharing.  These principles can be achieved through mechanisms like encryption of information and establishing trust relationships between entities on a path."];

Explicit Host-to-Network Flow
Measurements Techniques
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9506.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes protocol-independent methods called Explicit Host-to-Network Flow Measurement Techniques that can be applicable to transport-layer protocols between the client and server.  These methods employ just a few marking bits inside the header of each packet for performance measurements and require the client and server to collaborate.  Both endpoints cooperate by marking packets and, possibly, mirroring the markings on the round-trip connection.  The techniques are especially valuable when applied to protocols that encrypt transport headers since they enable loss and delay measurements by passive, on-path network devices.  This document describes several methods that can be used separately or jointly depending of the availability of marking bits, desired measurements, and properties of the protocol to which the methods are applied."];
