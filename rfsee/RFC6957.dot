Duplicate Address Detection Proxy

Based on the DAD signaling, the first-hop router stores in a Binding Table all known IPv6 addresses used on a point-to-multipoint domain (e.g., VLAN).

Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6
over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
Networks (6LoWPANs)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6775.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IETF work in IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) defines 6LoWPANs such as IEEE 802.15.4.  This and other similar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation.  In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow the traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non- transitive wireless links, as its reliance on the traditional IPv6 link concept and its heavy use of multicast make it inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low-power and lossy network.  This document describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, its addressing mechanisms, and duplicate address detection for Low- power Wireless Personal Area Networks and similar networks.  The document thus updates RFC 4944 to specify the use of the optimizations defined here. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Mobility Support in IPv6
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6275.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Mobile IPv6, a protocol that allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.

The binding between the public key and the address can be verified by re-computing the hash value and by comparing the hash with the interface identifier.  Messages sent from an IPv6 address can be protected by attaching the public key and auxiliary parameters and by signing the message with the corresponding private key.  The protection works without a certification authority or any security infrastructure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Securing Neighbor Discovery Proxy:
Problem Statement
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5909.html", target="_top", tooltip="Neighbor Discovery Proxies are used to provide an address presence on a link for nodes that are no longer present on the link. They allow a node to receive packets directed at its address by allowing another device to perform Neighbor Discovery operations on its behalf. Neighbor Discovery Proxy is used in Mobile IPv6 and related protocols to provide reachability from nodes on the home network when a Mobile Node is not at home, by allowing the Home Agent to act as proxy. It is also used as a mechanism to allow a global prefix to span multiple links, where proxies act as relays for Neighbor Discovery messages. Neighbor Discovery Proxy currently cannot be secured using Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND). Today, SEND assumes that a node advertising an address is the address owner and in possession of appropriate public and private keys for that node. This document describes how existing practice for proxy Neighbor Discovery relates to SEND. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Secure Proxy ND Support for SEcure
Neighbor Discovery (SEND)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6496.html", target="_top", tooltip="SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) specifies a method for securing Neighbor Discovery (ND) signaling against specific threats.  As defined today, SEND assumes that the node sending an ND message is the owner of the address from which the message is sent and/or possesses a key that authorizes the node to act as a router, so that it is in possession of the private key or keys used to generate the digital signature on each message.  This means that the Proxy ND signaling performed by nodes that do not possess knowledge of the address owner's private key and/or knowledge of a router's key cannot be secured using SEND.  This document extends the current SEND specification in order to secure Proxy ND operation.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

IPv6 architecture. The protocol uses multicast in many messages. It
also assumes a security model where all nodes on a link are trusted.
Such a design might be inefficient in some scenarios (e.g., use of
multicast in wireless networks) or when nodes are not trustworthy
(e.g., public access networks). These security and operational issues
and the associated mitigation solutions are documented in more than
twenty RFCs. There is a need to track these issues and solutions in a
single document. To that aim, this document summarizes the published ND issues and
then describes how all these issues originate from three causes.
Addressing the issues is made simpler by addressing the causes. This
document also analyzes the mitigation solutions and demonstrates that
isolating hosts into different subnets and links can help to address
the three causes. Guidance is provided for selecting a suitable
isolation method to prevent potential ND issues."];
