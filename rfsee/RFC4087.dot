Tunnel type values are not directly added to the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module; they must instead be added to the tunnelType IANA registry. Once a new tunnel type registration is made by IANA for a new tunneling scheme or even an existing one that is not already listed in the current registry (e.g., LISP, NSH), IANA will update the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module accordingly. Some of the IETF-defined tunneling techniques are not listed in the current IANA registry.
