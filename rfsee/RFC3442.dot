MAC-Forced Forwarding: A Method for
Subscriber Separation on an Ethernet
Access Network
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4562.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism to ensure layer-2 separation of Local Area Network (LAN) stations accessing an IPv4 gateway over a bridged Ethernet segment. The mechanism - called MAC-Forced Forwarding - implements an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) proxy function that prohibits Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) address resolution between hosts located within the same IPv4 subnet but at different customer premises, and in effect directs all upstream traffic to an IPv4 gateway. The IPv4 gateway provides IP-layer connectivity between these same hosts. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Improved Recursive DNS Server Selection
for Multi-Interfaced Nodes
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6731.html", target="_top", tooltip="A multi-interfaced node is connected to multiple networks, some of which might be utilizing private DNS namespaces.  A node commonly receives recursive DNS server configuration information from all connected networks.  Some of the recursive DNS servers might have information about namespaces other servers do not have.  When a multi-interfaced node needs to utilize DNS, the node has to choose which of the recursive DNS servers to use.  This document describes DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options that can be used to configure nodes with information required to perform informed recursive DNS server selection decisions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

IPv6 Multihoming without Network Address
Translation
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7157.html", target="_top", tooltip="Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) works well for conserving global addresses and addressing multihoming requirements because an IPv4 NAPT router implements three functions: source address selection, next-hop resolution, and (optionally) DNS resolution.  For IPv6 hosts, one approach could be the use of IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6).  However, NAT and NPTv6 should be avoided, if at all possible, to permit transparent end-to-end connectivity.  In this document, we analyze the use cases of multihoming.  We also describe functional requirements and possible solutions for multihoming without the use of NAT in IPv6 for hosts and small IPv6 networks that would otherwise be unable to meet minimum IPv6-allocation criteria.  We conclude that DHCPv6-based solutions are suitable to solve the multihoming issues described in this document, but NPTv6 may be required as an intermediate solution."];
