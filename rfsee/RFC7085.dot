In order to help researchers determine the extent of the issues with dotless domains, this document lists the current dotless TLDs and gives a script for finding them.  This document lists data about dotless TLDs but does not address the policy and technology issues other than to point to the statements of others.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
