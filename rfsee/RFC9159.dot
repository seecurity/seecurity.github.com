The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio headsets, and many other devices.  The low-power version of Bluetooth is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low-power variant of Bluetooth has been standardized since revision 4.0 of the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is required for IPv6.

Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6
over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
Networks (6LoWPANs)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6775.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IETF work in IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) defines 6LoWPANs such as IEEE 802.15.4.  This and other similar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation.  In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow the traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non- transitive wireless links, as its reliance on the traditional IPv6 link concept and its heavy use of multicast make it inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low-power and lossy network.  This document describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, its addressing mechanisms, and duplicate address detection for Low- power Wireless Personal Area Networks and similar networks.  The document thus updates RFC 4944 to specify the use of the optimizations defined here. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery for

The new extension is called Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND), and it protects the owner of an address against address theft and impersonation attacks in a Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN).  Nodes supporting this extension compute a cryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID), and use it with one or more of their Registered Addresses.  The Crypto-ID identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be used to provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses.  Once an address is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof of ownership is provided, only the owner of that address can modify the registration information, thereby enforcing Source Address Validation."];
