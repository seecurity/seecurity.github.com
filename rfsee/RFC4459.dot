MTU and Fragmentation Issues with In-
the-Network Tunneling
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Tunneling techniques such as IP-in-IP when deployed in the middle of the network, typically between routers, have certain issues regarding how large packets can be handled: whether such packets would be fragmented and reassembled (and how), whether Path MTU Discovery would be used, or how this scenario could be operationally avoided.  This memo justifies why this is a common, non-trivial problem, and goes on to describe the different solutions and their characteristics at some length.

IPv4 Reassembly Errors at High Data
Rates
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4963.html", target="_top", tooltip="IPv4 fragmentation is not sufficiently robust for use under some conditions in today's Internet.  At high data rates, the 16-bit IP identification field is not large enough to prevent frequent incorrectly assembled IP fragments, and the TCP and UDP checksums are insufficient to prevent the resulting corrupted datagrams from being delivered to higher protocol layers.  This note describes some easily reproduced experiments demonstrating the problem, and discusses some of the operational implications of these observations.

These virtual topologies may span multiple IP and/or sub-IP layer forwarding hops, and can introduce failure modes due to packet duplication and/or links with diverse Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs).  This document specifies a Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) that accommodates such virtual topologies over diverse underlying link technologies.

Mobile IPv6 Support for Dual Stack Hosts

Softwire Mesh Framework
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5565.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet needs to be able to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  However, it is expected that some constituent networks of the Internet will be single-protocol networks.  One kind of single-protocol network can parse only IPv4 packets and can process only IPv4 routing information; another kind can parse only IPv6 packets and can process only IPv6 routing information.  It is nevertheless required that either kind of single-protocol network be able to provide transit service for the other protocol.  This is done by passing the other kind of routing information from one edge of the single-protocol network to the other, and by tunneling the other kind of data packet from one edge to the other.  The tunnels are known as softwires.  This framework document explains how the routing information and the data packets of one protocol are passed through a single-protocol network of the other protocol.  The document is careful to specify when this can be done with existing technology and when it requires the development of new or modified technology. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Transmission of IPv4 Packets over the IP

The Locator/ID Separation Protocol

LISP defines two namespaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), which identify end hosts; and Routing Locators (RLOCs), which identify network attachment points. With this, LISP effectively separates control from data and allows routers to create overlay networks. LISP-capable routers exchange encapsulated packets according to EID-to-RLOC mappings stored in a local Map-Cache. LISP requires no change to either host protocol stacks or underlay routers and offers Traffic Engineering (TE), multihoming, and mobility, among other features. This document obsoletes RFC 6830."];
