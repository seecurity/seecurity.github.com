Exclusive XML Canonicalization, Version
1.0
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Canonical XML specifies a standard serialization of XML that, when applied to a subdocument, includes the subdocument's ancestor context including all of the namespace declarations and attributes in the xml: namespace.  However, some applications require a method which, to the extent practical, excludes ancestor context from a canonicalized subdocument.  For example, one might require a digital signature over an XML payload (subdocument) in an XML message that will not break when that subdocument is removed from its original message and/or inserted into a different context.  This requirement is satisfied by Exclusive XML Canonicalization.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

The Protocol versus Document Points of
View in Computer Protocols

Although each point of view has a place, adherence to a document point of view can be damaging to protocol design.  By understanding both points of view, conflicts between them may be clarified and reduced.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
