Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)
Attribute for Resource Priority
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5115.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a new attribute for the Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP) protocol.  The attribute associates protocols/services in the PSTN offering authorized prioritization during call setup that are reachable through a TRIP gateway.  Current examples of preferential service in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) are Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) in the U.S.  and Government Telephone Preference Scheme (GTPS) in the U.K.  The proposed attribute for TRIP is based on the NameSpace.Value tuple defined for the SIP Resource-Priority field.

Alternate Connectivity (ALTC) Attribute

The proposed attribute, the altc attribute, solves the backward-compatibility problem that plagued Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) due to their syntax. The proposed solution is applicable to scenarios where connectivity checks are not required. If connectivity checks are required, Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), as specified in RFC 5245, provides such a solution."];
