Geneve: Generic Network Virtualization
Encapsulation
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8926.html", target="_top", tooltip="Network virtualization involves the cooperation of devices with a wide variety of capabilities such as software and hardware tunnel endpoints, transit fabrics, and centralized control clusters.  As a result of their role in tying together different elements of the system, the requirements on tunnels are influenced by all of these components.  Therefore, flexibility is the most important aspect of a tunneling protocol if it is to keep pace with the evolution of technology.  This document describes Geneve, an encapsulation protocol designed to recognize and accommodate these changing capabilities and needs."];

The architecture is given at a high level, showing the major components of an overall system.  An important goal is to divide the space into individual smaller components that can be implemented independently with clear inter-component interfaces and interactions.  It should be possible to build and implement individual components in isolation and have them interoperate with other independently implemented components.  That way, implementers have flexibility in implementing individual components and can optimize and innovate within their respective components without requiring changes to other components."];
