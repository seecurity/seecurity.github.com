On the Applicability of Various
Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) Modes
and Extensions
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5197.html", target="_top", tooltip="Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) is a key management protocol that can be used for \%real-time applications. In particular, it has been defined focusing on the support of the Secure \%Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). MIKEY itself is standardized within RFC 3830 and defines four key distribution methods. Moreover, it is defined to allow extensions of the protocol. As MIKEY becomes more and more accepted, extensions to the base protocol arise, especially in terms of additional key distribution methods but also in terms of payload enhancements. This document provides an overview about the MIKEY base document in general as well as the existing extensions for MIKEY, which have been defined or are in the process of definition. It is intended as an additional source of information for developers or architects to provide more insight in use case scenarios and motivations as well as advantages and disadvantages for the different key distribution schemes. The use cases discussed in this document are strongly related to dedicated SIP call scenarios providing challenges for key management in general, among them media before Session Description Protocol (SDP) answer, forking, and shared key conferencing. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

IAX: Inter-Asterisk eXchange Version 2
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5456.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes IAX, the Inter-Asterisk eXchange protocol, an application-layer control and media protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. IAX was developed by the open source community for the Asterisk Private Branch Exchange (PBX) and is targeted primarily at Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call control, but it can be used with streaming video or any other type of multimedia. IAX is an all in one protocol for handling multimedia in IP networks. It combines both control and media services in the same protocol. In addition, IAX uses a single UDP data stream on a static port greatly simplifying Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway traversal, eliminating the need for other protocols to work around NAT, and simplifying network and firewall management. IAX employs a compact encoding that decreases bandwidth usage and is well suited for Internet telephony service. In addition, its open nature permits new payload type additions needed to support additional services.

Media Control Channel Framework

This implies that application programming logic can seamlessly gain access to appropriate resources that are not co-located on the same physical network entity. The framework uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish an application-level control mechanism between application servers and associated external servers such as media servers. The motivation for the creation of this framework is to provide an interface suitable to meet the requirements of a centralized conference system, where the conference system can be distributed, as defined by the XCON working group in the IETF. It is not, however, limited to this scope. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Latching: Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT) for

HNT is a set of mechanisms, such as media relaying and latching, that such intermediaries use to enable other RTC devices behind NATs to communicate with each other. This document is non-normative and is only written to explain HNT in order to provide a reference to the Internet community and an informative description to manufacturers and users. Latching, which is one of the HNT components, has a number of security issues covered here. Because of those, and unless all security considerations explained here are taken into account and solved, the IETF advises against use of the latching mechanism over the Internet and recommends other solutions, such as the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol."];
