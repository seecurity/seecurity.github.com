On the Generation of Transient Numeric
Identifiers

Subsequently, it provides advice on possible algorithms that could be employed to satisfy the interoperability requirements of each identifier category while minimizing the negative security and privacy implications, thus providing guidance to protocol designers and protocol implementers.  Finally, it describes a number of algorithms that have been employed in real implementations to generate transient numeric identifiers and analyzes their security and privacy properties.  This document is a product of the Privacy Enhancements and Assessments Research Group (PEARG) in the IRTF."];
