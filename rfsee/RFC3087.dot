A Call Control and Multi-Party Usage
Framework for the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5850.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a framework and the requirements for call control and multi-party usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  To enable discussion of multi-party features and applications, we define an abstract call model for describing the media relationships required by many of these.  The model and actions described here are specifically chosen to be independent of the SIP signaling and/or mixing approach chosen to actually set up the media relationships.  In addition to its dialog manipulation aspect, this framework includes requirements for communicating related information and events such as conference and session state and session history.  This framework also describes other goals that embody the spirit of SIP applications as used on the Internet such as the definition of primitives (not services), invoker and participant oriented primitives, signaling and mixing model independence, and others.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

This capability enables many enhanced services by providing the information as to how and why a SIP request arrives at a specific application or user.  This document defines an optional SIP header field, History-Info, for capturing the history information in requests.  The document also defines SIP header field parameters for the History-Info and Contact header fields to tag the method by which the target of a request is determined.  In addition, this specification defines a value for the Privacy header field that directs the anonymization of values in the History-Info header field.  This document obsoletes RFC 4244."];
