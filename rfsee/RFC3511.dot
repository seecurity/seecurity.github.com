This document provides complementary guidelines for evaluating the performance of IPv6 transition technologies.  More specifically, this document targets IPv6 transition technologies that employ encapsulation or translation mechanisms, as dual-stack nodes can be tested using the recommendations of RFCs 2544 and 5180.  The methodology also includes a metric for benchmarking load scalability."];
