A block of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end; these labels are commonly called reserved labels. They will be called special-purpose labels in this document.

This memo defines new procedures for the allocation and retirement of special-purpose labels, as well as a method to extend the special-purpose label space and a description of how to handle extended special-purpose labels in the data plane.
