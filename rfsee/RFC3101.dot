The OSPF Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA)
Option

The OSPF NSSA Option was originally defined in RFC 1587.  The functional differences between this memo and RFC 1587 are explained in Appendix F.  All differences, while expanding capability, are backward-compatible in nature.  Implementations of this memo and of RFC 1587 will interoperate. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
