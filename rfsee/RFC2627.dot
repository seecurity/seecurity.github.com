Key Provisioning for Group Communication

Candidate group members that act as Clients and are authorized to join a group can do so by interacting with a Key Distribution Center (KDC) acting as the Resource Server, from which they obtain the keying material to communicate with other group members.  While defining general message formats as well as the interface and operations available at the KDC, this document supports different approaches and protocols for secure group communication.  Therefore, details are delegated to separate application profiles of this document as specialized instances that target a particular group communication approach and define how communications in the group are protected.
