A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace

Identifier (CLEI) Code

The URN namespace is managed by Telcordia Technologies, Inc., as the maintenance agent for ANSI T1.213.  The CLEI code is a globally unique, ten-character alphanumeric intelligent code assigned by Telcordia Technologies at the request of equipment suppliers.  The CLEI code identifies communications equipment by specifying product type and features.  There is a one-to-one relationship between a CLEI code and supplier's product ID (the manufacturer's name and the part number along with its version number).

Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespace
Definition Mechanisms

The URN WG has defined a syntax for URNs in RFC 2141, as well as some proposed mechanisms for their resolution and use in Internet applications in RFC 3401 and RFC 3405.  The whole rests on the concept of individual namespaces within the URN structure.  Apart from proof-of-concept namespaces, the use of existing identifiers in URNs has been discussed in RFC 2288.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];

URNs for the Alert-Info Header Field of
the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7462.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to provide a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the User Agent (UA) as an alerting signal (e.g., a ring tone or ringback tone) when the user is alerted. This is done using the Alert-Info header field. However, the reference (typically a URL) addresses only a specific network resource with specific rendering properties. There is currently no support for standard identifiers for describing the semantics of the alerting situation or the characteristics of the alerting signal, without being tied to a particular rendering. To overcome these limitations and support new applications, a new family of URNs for use in Alert-Info header fields (and situations with similar requirements) is defined in this specification. This document normatively updates RFC 3261, which defines the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). It changes the usage of the Alert-Info header field defined in RFC 3261 by additionally allowing its use in any non-100 provisional response to INVITE. This document also permits proxies to add or remove an Alert-Info header field and to add or remove Alert-Info header field values."];
