Extensible Prioritization Scheme for
HTTP
2022", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a scheme that allows an HTTP client to communicate its preferences for how the upstream server prioritizes responses to its requests, and also allows a server to hint to a downstream intermediary how its responses should be prioritized when they are forwarded.  This document defines the Priority header field for communicating the initial priority in an HTTP version-independent manner, as well as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frames for reprioritizing responses.  These share a common format structure that is designed to provide future extensibility.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2
(HTTP/2)
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7540.html", target="_top", tooltip="This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP version 2 (HTTP/2). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients. This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged."];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8126.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters. To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry. This is the third edition of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226."];

An Abstract Application Programming

This API enables faster deployment of new protocols and protocol features without requiring changes to the applications.  The specified API follows the Transport Services Architecture by providing asynchronous, atomic transmission of Messages.  It is intended to replace the BSD Socket API as the common interface to the transport layer, in an environment where endpoints could select from multiple network paths and potential transport protocols."];
