Internet Message Store Events
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5423.html", target="_top", tooltip="One of the missing features in the existing Internet mail and messaging standards is a facility for server-to-server and server-to- client event notifications related to message store events. As the scope of Internet mail expands to support more diverse media (such as voice mail) and devices (such as cell phones) and to provide rich interactions with other services (such as web portals and legal compliance systems), the need for an interoperable notification system increases. This document attempts to enumerate the types of events that interest real-world consumers of such a system. This document describes events and event parameters that are useful for several cases, including notification to administrative systems and end users. This is not intended as a replacement for a message access facility such as IMAP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Internet Mail Architecture
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5598.html", target="_top", tooltip="Over its thirty-five-year history, Internet Mail has changed significantly in scale and complexity, as it has become a global infrastructure service.  These changes have been evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve both its installed base and its usefulness.  To collaborate productively on this large and complex system, all participants need to work from a common view of it and use a common language to describe its components and the interactions among them.  But the many differences in perspective currently make it difficult to know exactly what another participant means.  To serve as the necessary common frame of reference, this document describes the enhanced Internet Mail architecture, reflecting the current service.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Interoperability Profile for Relay User
Equipment
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9248.html", target="_top", tooltip="Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by which a hearing person can communicate with a sign language speaker who is deaf, deafblind, or hard of hearing (HoH) or has a speech disability using an interpreter (i.e., a Communications Assistant (CA)) connected via a videophone to the sign language speaker and an audio telephone call to the hearing user.  The CA interprets using sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.  Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency, termed a provider in this document.  The provider also provides a video service that allows users to connect video devices to their service and subsequently to CAs and other sign language speakers.  It is desirable that the videophones used by the sign language speaker conform to a standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that direct video calls between sign language speakers work.  This document describes the interface between a videophone and a provider."];
