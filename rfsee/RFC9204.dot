In addition to outlining the principles that underlie the concept of origin, this document details how to determine the origin of a URI and how to serialize an origin into a string.  It also defines an HTTP header field, named Origin, that indicates which origins are associated with an HTTP request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
