Update to the Include Route Object (IRO)
Specification in the Path Computation
Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) enables communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two PCEs. RFC 5440 defines the Include Route Object (IRO) to specify network elements to be traversed in the computed path. The specification does not specify if the IRO contains an ordered or unordered list of subobjects. During recent discussions, it was determined that there was a need to define a standard representation to ensure interoperability. It was also noted that there is a benefit in the handling of an attribute of the IRO's subobject, the L bit. This document updates RFC 5440 regarding the IRO specification.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

A Backward-Recursive PCE-Based

Shortest Constrained Inter-Domain
Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths

In this context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems.  This document specifies a procedure relying on the use of multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute such inter-domain shortest constrained paths across a predetermined sequence of domains, using a backward-recursive path computation technique.  This technique preserves confidentiality across domains, which is sometimes required when domains are managed by different service providers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
