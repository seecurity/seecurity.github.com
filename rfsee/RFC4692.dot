Considerations on the IPv6 Host Density
Metric

This document contrasts the address efficiency as currently adopted in the allocation of IPv4 network addresses and that used by the IPv6 protocol.  Note that for large allocations there are very significant variations in the target efficiency metric between the two approaches.
