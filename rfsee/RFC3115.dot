Cisco's Mobile IPv4 Host Configuration
Extensions
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4332.html", target="_top", tooltip="An IP device requires basic host configuration to be able to communicate.  For example, it will typically require an IP address and the address of a DNS server.  This information is configured statically or obtained dynamically using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or Point-to-Point Protocol/IP Control Protocol (PPP/IPCP).  However, both DHCP and PPP/IPCP provide host configuration based on the access network.  In Mobile IPv4, the registration process boots up a Mobile Node at an access network, also known as a foreign network.  The information to configure the host needs to be based on the home network.  This document describes the Cisco vendor-specific extensions to Mobile IPv4 to provide the base host configuration in Registration Request and Reply messages.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
