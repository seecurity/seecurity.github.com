Multicast Listener Extensions for Mobile
IPv6 (MIPv6) and Proxy Mobile IPv6
(PMIPv6) Fast Handovers
2014", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Fast handover protocols for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) and Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) define mobility management procedures that support unicast communication at reduced handover latency. Fast handover base operations do not affect multicast communication and, hence, do not accelerate handover management for native multicast listeners. Many multicast applications like IPTV or conferencing, though, comprise delay-sensitive, real-time traffic and will benefit from fast handover completion. This document specifies extension of the Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers (FMIPv6) and the Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PFMIPv6) protocols to include multicast traffic management in fast handover operations. This multicast support is provided first at the control plane by management of rapid context transfer between access routers and second at the data plane by optional fast traffic forwarding that may include buffering. An FMIPv6 access router indicates support for multicast using an updated Proxy Router Advertisements message format.

Mobility Support in IPv6
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6275.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Mobile IPv6, a protocol that allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.

Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5949.html", target="_top", tooltip="Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6; RFC 3775) provides a mobile node with IP mobility when it performs a handover from one access router to another, and fast handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) are specified to enhance the handover performance in terms of latency and packet loss. While MIPv6 (and FMIPv6 as well) requires the participation of the mobile node in the mobility-related signaling, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6; RFC 5213) provides IP mobility to nodes that either have or do not have MIPv6 functionality without such involvement. Nevertheless, the basic performance of PMIPv6 in terms of handover latency and packet loss is considered no different from that of MIPv6. When the fast handover is considered in such an environment, several modifications are needed to FMIPv6 to adapt to the network-based mobility management. This document specifies the usage of fast handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6; RFC 5568) when Proxy Mobile IPv6 is used as the mobility management protocol. Necessary extensions are specified for FMIPv6 to support the scenario when the mobile node does not have IP mobility functionality and hence is not involved with either MIPv6 or FMIPv6 operations.
