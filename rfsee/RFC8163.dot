Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6
over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area

This and other similar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation.  In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow the traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non- transitive wireless links, as its reliance on the traditional IPv6 link concept and its heavy use of multicast make it inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low-power and lossy network.

Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration in IPv6
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4941.html", target="_top", tooltip="Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate addresses using a combination of locally available information and information advertised by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining network prefixes with an interface identifier.  On an interface that contains an embedded IEEE Identifier, the interface identifier is typically derived from it.  On other interface types, the interface identifier is generated through other means, for example, via random number generation.  This document describes an extension to IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration for interfaces whose interface identifier is derived from an IEEE identifier.  Use of the extension causes nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface identifiers that change over time, even in cases where the interface contains an embedded IEEE identifier.  Changing the interface identifier (and the global scope addresses generated from it) over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to identify when different addresses used in different transactions actually correspond to the same node.

Hash-Based Addresses (HBA)

This mechanism employs either Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) or a new variant of the same theme that uses the same format in the addresses.  The main idea in the new variant is that information about the multiple prefixes is included within the addresses themselves.  This is achieved by generating the interface identifiers of the addresses of a host as hashes of the available prefixes and a random number.  Then, the multiple addresses are generated by prepending the different prefixes to the generated interface identifiers.  The result is a set of addresses, called Hash-Based Addresses (HBAs), that are inherently bound to each other. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
