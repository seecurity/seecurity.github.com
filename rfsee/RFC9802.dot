Leighton-Micali Hash-Based Signatures
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8554.html", target="_top", tooltip="This note describes a digital-signature system based on cryptographic hash functions, following the seminal work in this area of Lamport, Diffie, Winternitz, and Merkle, as adapted by Leighton and Micali in 1995. It specifies a one-time signature scheme and a general signature scheme. These systems provide asymmetric authentication without using large integer mathematics and can achieve a high security level. They are suitable for compact implementations, are relatively simple to implement, and are naturally resistant to side-channel attacks. Unlike many other signature systems, hash-based signatures would still be secure even if it proves feasible for an attacker to build a quantum computer. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF. This has been reviewed by many researchers, both in the research group and outside of it.

XMSS: eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8391.html", target="_top", tooltip="This note describes the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), a hash-based digital signature system that is based on existing descriptions in scientific literature.  This note specifies Winternitz One-Time Signature Plus (WOTS+), a one-time signature scheme; XMSS, a single-tree scheme; and XMSS^MT, a multi-tree variant of XMSS.  Both XMSS and XMSS^MT use WOTS+ as a main building block.  XMSS provides cryptographic digital signatures without relying on the conjectured hardness of mathematical problems.  Instead, it is proven that it only relies on the properties of cryptographic hash functions.  XMSS provides strong security guarantees and is even secure when the collision resistance of the underlying hash function is broken.  It is suitable for compact implementations, is relatively simple to implement, and naturally resists side-channel attacks.  Unlike most other signature systems, hash-based signatures can so far withstand known attacks using quantum computers."];
