At the end of the protocol, the client learns the PRF output without learning anything about the PRF private key, and the server learns neither the PRF input nor output.  An OPRF can also satisfy a notion of 'verifiability', called a VOPRF.  A VOPRF ensures clients can verify that the server used a specific private key during the execution of the protocol.  A VOPRF can also be partially oblivious, called a POPRF.  A POPRF allows clients and servers to provide public input to the PRF computation.
