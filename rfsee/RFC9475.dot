This document explores the applicability of STIR's Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) and certificate issuance framework to text and multimedia messaging use cases, including support for both messages carried as a payload in SIP requests and messages sent in sessions negotiated by SIP."];

Secure Telephone Identity Problem
Statement and Requirements
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7340.html", target="_top", tooltip="Over the past decade, Voice over IP (VoIP) systems based on SIP have replaced many traditional telephony deployments.  Interworking VoIP systems with the traditional telephone network has reduced the overall level of calling party number and Caller ID assurances by granting attackers new and inexpensive tools to impersonate or obscure calling party numbers when orchestrating bulk commercial calling schemes, hacking voicemail boxes, or even circumventing multi-factor authentication systems trusted by banks.  Despite previous attempts to provide a secure assurance of the origin of SIP communications, we still lack effective standards for identifying the calling party in a VoIP session.  This document examines the reasons why providing identity for telephone numbers on the Internet has proven so difficult and shows how changes in the last decade may provide us with new strategies for attaching a secure identity to SIP sessions.  It also gives high-level requirements for a solution in this space."];

The Personal Assertion Token, PASSporT, is cryptographically signed to protect the integrity of the identity of the originator and to verify the assertion of the identity information at the destination.  The cryptographic signature is defined with the intention that it can confidently verify the originating persona even when the signature is sent to the destination party over an insecure channel.  PASSporT is particularly useful for many personal-communications applications over IP networks and other multi-hop interconnection scenarios where the originating and destination parties may not have a direct trusted relationship."];

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Extension for Instant Messaging

This document proposes the MESSAGE method, an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that allows the transfer of Instant Messages.  Since the MESSAGE request is an extension to SIP, it inherits all the request routing and security features of that protocol.  MESSAGE requests carry the content in the form of MIME body parts.  MESSAGE requests do not themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal usage each Instant Message stands alone, much like pager messages.  MESSAGE requests may be sent in the context of a dialog initiated by some other SIP request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

These abilities have several benefits: Receivers can provide feedback to Domain Owners about the use of their domains; this feedback can provide valuable insight about the management of internal operations and the presence of external domain name abuse. DMARC does not produce or encourage elevated delivery privilege of authenticated email.
