A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Response Code for Rejected Calls
2019", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines the 608 (Rejected) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) response code.  This response code enables calling parties to learn that an intermediary rejected their call attempt.  No one will deliver, and thus answer, the call.  As a 6xx code, the caller will be aware that future attempts to contact the same User Agent Server will likely fail.  The initial use case driving the need for the 608 response code is when the intermediary is an analytics engine.  In this case, the rejection is by a machine or other process.  This contrasts with the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response code in which a human at the target User Agent Server indicates the user did not want the call.  In some jurisdictions, this distinction is important.  This document also defines the use of the Call-Info header field in 608 responses to enable rejected callers to contact entities that blocked their calls in error.  This provides a remediation mechanism for legal callers that find their calls blocked.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
and Spam
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5039.html", target="_top", tooltip="Spam, defined as the transmission of bulk unsolicited messages, has plagued Internet email.  Unfortunately, spam is not limited to email.  It can affect any system that enables user-to-user communications.  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) defines a system for user-to- user multimedia communications.  Therefore, it is susceptible to spam, just as email is.  In this document, we analyze the problem of spam in SIP.  We first identify the ways in which the problem is the same and the ways in which it is different from email.  We then examine the various possible solutions that have been discussed for email and consider their applicability to SIP.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Secure Telephone Identity Problem
Statement and Requirements
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7340.html", target="_top", tooltip="Over the past decade, Voice over IP (VoIP) systems based on SIP have replaced many traditional telephony deployments.  Interworking VoIP systems with the traditional telephone network has reduced the overall level of calling party number and Caller ID assurances by granting attackers new and inexpensive tools to impersonate or obscure calling party numbers when orchestrating bulk commercial calling schemes, hacking voicemail boxes, or even circumventing multi-factor authentication systems trusted by banks.  Despite previous attempts to provide a secure assurance of the origin of SIP communications, we still lack effective standards for identifying the calling party in a VoIP session.  This document examines the reasons why providing identity for telephone numbers on the Internet has proven so difficult and shows how changes in the last decade may provide us with new strategies for attaching a secure identity to SIP sessions.  It also gives high-level requirements for a solution in this space."];

The Reason Header Field for the Session

This contact is generally in the form of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), such as Contact: <sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com> and is generally dynamic and associated with the IP address or hostname of the SIP User Agent (UA).  The problem is that network topology may have one or more SIP proxies between the UA and the registrar, such that any request traveling from the user's home network to the registered UA must traverse these proxies.  The REGISTER method does not give us a mechanism to discover and record this sequence of proxies in the registrar for future use.
