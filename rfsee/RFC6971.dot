Depth-First Forwarding (DFF) in
Unreliable Networks
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies the Depth-First Forwarding (DFF) protocol for IPv6 networks, a data-forwarding mechanism that can increase reliability of data delivery in networks with dynamic topology and/or lossy links.  The protocol operates entirely on the forwarding plane but may interact with the routing plane.  DFF forwards data packets using a mechanism similar to a depth-first search for the destination of a packet.  The routing plane may be informed of failures to deliver a packet or loops.  This document specifies the DFF mechanism both for IPv6 networks (as specified in RFC 2460) and for mesh-under Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs), as specified in RFC 4944.  The design of DFF assumes that the underlying link layer provides means to detect if a packet has been successfully delivered to the Next Hop or not.  It is applicable for networks with little traffic and is used for unicast transmissions only.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6
over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
Networks (6LoWPANs)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6775.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IETF work in IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) defines 6LoWPANs such as IEEE 802.15.4.  This and other similar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation.  In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow the traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non- transitive wireless links, as its reliance on the traditional IPv6 link concept and its heavy use of multicast make it inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low-power and lossy network.  This document describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, its addressing mechanisms, and duplicate address detection for Low- power Wireless Personal Area Networks and similar networks.  The document thus updates RFC 4944 to specify the use of the optimizations defined here. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Default Address Selection for Internet
Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6724.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes two algorithms, one for source address selection and one for destination address selection. The algorithms specify default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations. They do not override choices made by applications or upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the development of more advanced mechanisms for address selection. The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior. In dual-stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses -- depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice versa. Default address selection as defined in this specification applies to all IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers. This document obsoletes RFC 3484. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
