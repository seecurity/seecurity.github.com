An Extension for Application-Layer

2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9275.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol.  It extends the ALTO cost map and ALTO property map services so that an application can decide to which endpoint(s) to connect based not only on numerical/ordinal cost values but also on fine-grained abstract information regarding the paths.  This is useful for applications whose performance is impacted by specific components of a network on the end-to-end paths, e.g., they may infer that several paths share common links and prevent traffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths.  This extension introduces a new abstraction called the Abstract Network Element (ANE) to represent these components and encodes a network path as a vector of ANEs.  Thus, it provides a more complete but still abstract graph representation of the underlying network(s) for informed traffic optimization among endpoints."];

Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable
Throughput (L4S) Internet Service:
Architecture
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9330.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet applications to achieve low queuing latency, low congestion loss, and scalable throughput control. L4S is based on the insight that the root cause of queuing delay is in the capacity-seeking congestion controllers of senders, not in the queue itself. With the L4S architecture, all Internet applications could (but do not have to) transition away from congestion control algorithms that cause substantial queuing delay and instead adopt a new class of congestion controls that can seek capacity with very little queuing. These are aided by a modified form of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) from the network. With this new architecture, applications can have both low latency and high throughput. The architecture primarily concerns incremental deployment. It defines mechanisms that allow the new class of L4S congestion controls to coexist with 'Classic' congestion controls in a shared network. The aim is for L4S latency and throughput to be usually much better (and rarely worse) while typically not impacting Classic performance."];

RFC 8895, which describes ALTO incremental updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE), defines a multiplexing protocol on top of HTTP/1.x, so that an ALTO server can incrementally push resource updates to clients whenever monitored network information resources change, allowing the clients to monitor multiple resources at the same time. However, HTTP/2 and later versions already support concurrent, non-blocking transport of multiple streams in the same HTTP connection. To take advantage of newer HTTP features, this document introduces the ALTO Transport Information Publication Service (TIPS). TIPS uses an incremental RESTful design to give an ALTO client the new capability to explicitly and concurrently (in a non-blocking manner) request (or pull) specific incremental updates using HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, while still functioning for HTTP/1.1."];
