Implementing an Emergency

Protocol Suite
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4542.html", target="_top", tooltip="RFCs 3689 and 3690 detail requirements for an Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS), of which an Internet Emergency Preparedness Service (IEPS) would be a part. Some of these types of services require call preemption; others require call queuing or other mechanisms. IEPS requires a Call Admission Control (CAC) procedure and a Per Hop Behavior (PHB) for the data that meet the needs of this architecture. Such a CAC procedure and PHB is appropriate to any service that might use H.323 or SIP to set up real-time sessions. The key requirement is to guarantee an elevated probability of call completion to an authorized user in time of crisis. This document primarily discusses supporting ETS in the context of the US Government and NATO, because it focuses on the Multi-Level Precedence and Preemption (MLPP) and Government Emergency Telecommunication Service (GETS) standards. The architectures described here are applicable beyond these organizations. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
Extensions for Path-Triggered RSVP
Receiver Proxy
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5946.html", target="_top", tooltip="Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) signaling can be used to make end-to-end resource reservations in an IP network in order to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) required by certain flows.  With conventional RSVP, both the data sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling.  Yet, there are many use cases where resource reservation is required, but the receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable.  Where the receiver is not RSVP- capable, an RSVP router may behave as an RSVP Receiver Proxy, thereby performing RSVP signaling on behalf of the receiver.  This allows resource reservations to be established on the segment of the end-to- end path from the sender to the RSVP Receiver Proxy.  However, as discussed in the companion document RSVP Proxy Approaches, RSVP extensions are needed to facilitate operations with an RSVP Receiver Proxy whose signaling is triggered by receipt of RSVP Path messages from the sender.  This document specifies these extensions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

QSPEC Template for the Quality-of-
Service NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol
(NSLP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5975.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Quality-of-Service (QoS) NSIS signaling layer protocol (NSLP) is used to signal QoS reservations and is independent of a specific QoS model (QOSM) such as IntServ or Diffserv.  Rather, all information specific to a QOSM is encapsulated in a separate object, the QSPEC.  This document defines a template for the QSPEC including a number of QSPEC parameters.  The QSPEC parameters provide a common language to be reused in several QOSMs and thereby aim to ensure the extensibility and interoperability of QoS NSLP.  While the base protocol is QOSM-agnostic, the parameters that can be carried in the QSPEC object are possibly closely coupled to specific models.  The node initiating the NSIS signaling adds an Initiator QSPEC, which indicates the QSPEC parameters that must be interpreted by the downstream nodes less the reservation fails, thereby ensuring the intention of the NSIS initiator is preserved along the signaling path.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

RSVP Extensions for Admission Priority
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6401.html", target="_top", tooltip="Some applications require the ability to provide an elevated probability of session establishment to specific sessions in times of network congestion. When supported over the Internet Protocol suite, this may be facilitated through a network-layer admission control solution that supports prioritized access to resources (e.g., bandwidth). These resources may be explicitly set aside for prioritized sessions, or may be shared with other sessions. This document specifies extensions to the Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) that can be used to support such an admission priority capability at the network layer. Based on current security concerns, these extensions are intended for use in a single administrative domain. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
