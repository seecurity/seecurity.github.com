Deprecating Unicode Language Tag
Characters: RFC 2482 is Historic

The Unicode Consortium has deprecated that facility and strongly recommends against its use.  RFC 2482 has been moved to Historic status to reduce the possibility that Internet implementers would consider that system an appropriate mechanism for identifying languages.
