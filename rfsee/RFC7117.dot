For example, it may result in highly non-optimal bandwidth utilization when a large amount of multicast traffic is to be transported. This document describes solutions for overcoming a subset of the limitations of the existing VPLS multicast solution. It describes procedures for VPLS multicast that utilize multicast trees in the service provider (SP) network.
