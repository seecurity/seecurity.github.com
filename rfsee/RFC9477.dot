Complaint Feedback Loop Address Header
2023", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a method that allows a Message Originator to specify a Complaint Feedback Loop (CFBL) address as a message header field. It also defines the rules for processing and forwarding such a complaint. The motivation for this arises out of the absence of a standardized and automated way to provide Mailbox Providers with an address for a CFBL. Currently, providing and maintaining such an address is a manual and time-consuming process for Message Originators and Mailbox Providers. The mechanism specified in this document is being published as an experiment to gather feedback and gauge the interest of implementers and deployers.

Complaint Feedback Loop Operational

This document is an attempt to codify, and thus clarify, the ways that both providers and consumers of these feedback mechanisms intend to use the feedback, describing some already common industry practices. This document is the result of cooperative efforts within the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group, a trade organization separate from the IETF. The original MAAWG document upon which this document is based was published in April, 2010. This document does not represent the consensus of the IETF; rather it is being published as an Informational RFC to make it widely available to the Internet community and simplify reference to this material from IETF work.

It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.

Internationalized Email Headers

MIME added support for the use of 8-bit character sets in body parts, and also defined an encoded-word construct so other character sets could be used in certain header field values. However, full internationalization of electronic mail requires additional enhancements to allow the use of Unicode, including characters outside the ASCII repertoire, in mail addresses as well as direct use of Unicode in header fields like From:, To:, and Subject:, without requiring the use of complex encoded-word constructs. This document specifies an enhancement to the Internet Message Format and to MIME that allows use of Unicode in mail addresses and most header field content.
