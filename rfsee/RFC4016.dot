Protocol for Carrying Authentication for
Network Access (PANA) Requirements
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4058.html", target="_top", tooltip="It is expected that future IP devices will have a variety of access technologies to gain network connectivity.  Currently there are access-specific mechanisms for providing client information to the network for authentication and authorization purposes.  In addition to being limited to specific access media (e.g., 802.1X for IEEE 802 links), some of these protocols are limited to specific network topologies (e.g., PPP for point-to-point links).  The goal of this document is to identify the requirements for a link-layer agnostic protocol that allows a host and a network to authenticate each other for network access.  This protocol will run between a client's device and an agent in the network where the agent might be a client of the AAA infrastructure.

Internet of Things (IoT) Security: State
of the Art and Challenges
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8576.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication. The security needs for IoT systems are well recognized, and many standardization steps to provide security have been taken -- for example, the specification of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) secured with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). However, security challenges still exist, not only because there are some use cases that lack a suitable solution, but also because many IoT devices and systems have been designed and deployed with very limited security capabilities. In this document, we first discuss the various stages in the lifecycle of a thing. Next, we document the security threats to a thing and the challenges that one might face to protect against these threats. Lastly, we discuss the next steps needed to facilitate the deployment of secure IoT systems. This document can be used by implementers and authors of IoT specifications as a reference for details about security considerations while documenting their specific security challenges, threat models, and mitigations. This document is a product of the IRTF Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG)."];
