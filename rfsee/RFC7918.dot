TCP Fast Open
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7413.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes an experimental TCP mechanism called TCP Fast Open (TFO).  TFO allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake, and saves up to one full round-trip time (RTT) compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged.  However, TFO deviates from the standard TCP semantics, since the data in the SYN could be replayed to an application in some rare circumstances.  Applications should not use TFO unless they can tolerate this issue, as detailed in the Applicability section."];

These shortcomings arise from lack of clarity about which DH group parameters TLS servers should offer and clients should accept. This document offers a solution to these shortcomings for compatible peers by using a section of the TLS Supported Groups Registry (renamed from EC Named Curve Registry by this document) to establish common finite field DH parameters with known structure and a mechanism for peers to negotiate support for these groups.
