Introduction to proposed DoD standard
H-FP
1984", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The broad outline of the Host-Front End Protocol introduced here and described in RFC-929 is the result of the deliberations of a number of experienced H-FP designers, who sat as a committee of the DoD Protocol Standards Technical Panel.  It is the intent of the designers that the protocol be subjected to multiple test implementations and probable iteration before being agreed upon as any sort of standard.  Therefore, the first order of business is to declare that THIS IS A PROPOSAL, NOT A FINAL STANDARD, and the second order of business is to request that any readers of these documents who are able to do test implementations (a) do so and (b) coordinate their efforts with the author.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
