Common Misbehavior Against DNS Queries
for IPv6 Addresses

Such behavior can block IPv4 communication that should actually be available, cause a significant delay in name resolution, or even make a denial of service attack.  This memo describes details of known cases and discusses their effects.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
