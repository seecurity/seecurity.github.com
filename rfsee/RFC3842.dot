An Extension to Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) Events for Conditional
Event Notification
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5839.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables receiving asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP user agents.  This framework defines the procedures for creating, refreshing, and terminating subscriptions, as well as fetching and periodic polling of resource state.  These procedures provide no tools to avoid replaying event notifications that have already been received by a user agent.  This memo defines an extension to SIP events that allows the subscriber to condition the subscription request to whether the state has changed since the previous notification was received.  When such a condition is true, either the body of a resulting event notification or the entire notification message is suppressed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A Call Control and Multi-Party Usage
Framework for the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5850.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a framework and the requirements for call control and multi-party usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  To enable discussion of multi-party features and applications, we define an abstract call model for describing the media relationships required by many of these.  The model and actions described here are specifically chosen to be independent of the SIP signaling and/or mixing approach chosen to actually set up the media relationships.  In addition to its dialog manipulation aspect, this framework includes requirements for communicating related information and events such as conference and session state and session history.  This framework also describes other goals that embody the spirit of SIP applications as used on the Internet such as the definition of primitives (not services), invoker and participant oriented primitives, signaling and mixing model independence, and others.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Interoperability Profile for Relay User
Equipment
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9248.html", target="_top", tooltip="Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by which a hearing person can communicate with a sign language speaker who is deaf, deafblind, or hard of hearing (HoH) or has a speech disability using an interpreter (i.e., a Communications Assistant (CA)) connected via a videophone to the sign language speaker and an audio telephone call to the hearing user.  The CA interprets using sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.  Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency, termed a provider in this document.  The provider also provides a video service that allows users to connect video devices to their service and subsequently to CAs and other sign language speakers.  It is desirable that the videophones used by the sign language speaker conform to a standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that direct video calls between sign language speakers work.  This document describes the interface between a videophone and a provider."];
