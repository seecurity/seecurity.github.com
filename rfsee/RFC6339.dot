This is done by defining a new SASL mechanism family, called GS2.  This mechanism family offers a number of improvements over the previous SASL/ GSSAPI mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer messages for the authentication phase in some cases, and supports negotiable use of channel binding.  Only GSS-API mechanisms that support channel binding and mutual authentication are supported. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
