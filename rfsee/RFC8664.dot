This specification changes some of the registries with Standards Action to IETF Review as defined in RFC 8126 and thus updates RFCs 8231, 8233, 8281, 8623, 8664, 8685, 8697, 8733, 8745, 8779, 8780, 8800, 8934, 9050, 9059, 9168, 9357, 9504, 9603, and 9604. Designating experimental use sub-ranges within codepoint registries is often beneficial for protocol experimentation in controlled environments. Although the registries for PCEP messages, objects, and TLV types have sub-ranges assigned for Experimental Use, the registry for PCEP Error-Types and Error-values currently does not. This document updates RFC 5440 by designating a specific range of PCEP Error-Types for Experimental Use."];

Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Segment
Routing (SR) Policy Candidate Paths
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9862.html", target="_top", tooltip="A Segment Routing (SR) Policy is an ordered list of instructions called segments that represent a source-routed policy. Packet flows are steered into an SR Policy on a node where it is instantiated. An SR Policy is made of one or more Candidate Paths. This document specifies the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) extension to signal Candidate Paths of an SR Policy. Additionally, this document updates RFC 8231 to allow delegation and setup of an SR Label Switched Path (LSP) without using the path computation request and reply messages. This document is applicable to both Segment Routing over MPLS (SR-MPLS) and Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6)."];

For example, a TE Tunnel constructed to deliver low latency services and whose path is optimized for delay can be tagged with a color that represents low latency. This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) to carry the color attribute."];
