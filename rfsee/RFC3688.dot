A Network YANG Data Model for Attachment

The model can be used for the provisioning of attachment circuits prior or during service provisioning (e.g., VPN, Network Slice Service). A companion service model is specified in the YANG Data Models for Bearers and 'Attachment Circuits'-as-a-Service (ACaaS) (I-D.ietf- opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit). The module augments the base network ('ietf-network') and the Service Attachment Point (SAP) models with the detailed information for the provisioning of attachment circuits in Provider Edges (PEs)."];

A YANG Data Model for Augmenting VPN

2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9836.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a YANG data model, referred to as the AC Glue
model, to augment the LxVPN Service Model (LxSM) and LxVPN Network
Model (LxNM) with references to attachment circuits (ACs).  The AC
Glue model enables a provider to associate Layer 2/3 VPN (LxVPN)
services with the underlying AC infrastructure, thereby facilitating
consistent provisioning and management of new or existing ACs in
conjunction with LxVPN services.  Specifically, by introducing an
integrated approach to AC and LxVPN management, this model supports
Attachment Circuit as a Service (ACaaS) and provides a standardized
mechanism for aligning AC/VPN requests with the network
configurations required to deliver them."];
