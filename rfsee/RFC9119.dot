It describes problems arising from mobile group communication in general, the case of multicast listener mobility, and problems for mobile senders using Any Source Multicast and Source-Specific Multicast.  Characteristic aspects of multicast routing and deployment issues for fixed IPv6 networks are summarized.  Specific properties and interplays with the underlying network access are surveyed with respect to the relevant technologies in the wireless domain.  It outlines the principal approaches to multicast mobility, together with a comprehensive exploration of the mobile multicast problem and solution space.  This document concludes with a conceptual road map for initial steps in standardization for use by future mobile multicast protocol designers.

Multicast DNS

In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including, but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server is useful. Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server. In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use, without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names. The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work when no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure failures."];
