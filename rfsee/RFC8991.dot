GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol
Application Program Interface (GRASP
API)

Such an API is needed for Autonomic Service Agents (ASAs) calling the GRASP protocol module to exchange Autonomic Network messages with other ASAs.  Since GRASP is designed to support asynchronous operations, the API will need to be adapted according to the support for asynchronicity in various programming languages and operating systems.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

An Autonomic Control Plane (ACP)
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8994.html", target="_top", tooltip="Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which depends on some addressing and routing.  This Autonomic Control Plane should ideally be self-managing and be as independent as possible of configuration.  This document defines such a plane and calls it the Autonomic Control Plane, with the primary use as a control plane for autonomic functions.  It also serves as a virtual out-of-band channel for Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) communications over a network that provides automatically configured, hop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via automatically configured IPv6 even when the network is not configured or is misconfigured."];

Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
Infrastructure (BRSKI)
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8995.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic Control Plane.  To do this, a Secure Key Infrastructure is bootstrapped.  This is done using manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing service, both online and offline.  We call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol.  Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks.  Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included.  Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well."];
