Ingress Replication Tunnels in Multicast
VPN
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="RFCs 6513, 6514, and other RFCs describe procedures by which a Service Provider may offer Multicast VPN (MVPN) service to its customers.  These procedures create point-to-multipoint (P2MP) or multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) trees across the Service Provider's backbone.  One type of P2MP tree that may be used is known as an Ingress Replication (IR) tunnel.  In an IR tunnel, a parent node need not be directly connected to its child nodes.  When a parent node has to send a multicast data packet to its n child nodes, it does not use Layer 2 multicast, IP multicast, or MPLS multicast to do so.  Rather, it makes n individual copies, and then unicasts each copy, through an IP or MPLS unicast tunnel, to exactly one child node.  While the prior MVPN specifications allow the use of IR tunnels, those specifications are not always very clear or explicit about how the MVPN protocol elements and procedures are applied to IR tunnels.  This document updates RFCs 6513 and 6514 by adding additional details that are specific to the use of IR tunnels."];

LDP Specification

A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through them.  This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has made.  This document defines a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths.

If ingress replication is used within an IGP area, then (multipoint-to-point) LDP LSPs or (point-to-point) RSVP-TE LSPs may be used in the IGP area.

Encodings have been defined that allow the PMSI Tunnel attribute to identify bidirectional (multipoint-to-multipoint) multicast distribution trees.  However, the prior RFCs do not provide all the necessary procedures for using bidirectional tunnels to support multicast VPNs.  This document updates RFCs 6513, 6514, and 6625 by specifying those procedures.

IPv4 and IPv6 Infrastructure Addresses
in BGP Updates for Multicast VPN
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6515.html", target="_top", tooltip="To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) service, Provider Edge routers originate BGP Update messages that carry Multicast-VPN (MCAST-VPN) BGP routes; they also originate unicast VPN routes that carry MVPN-specific attributes.  These routes encode addresses from the customer's address space, as well as addresses from the provider's address space.  These two address spaces are independent, and the address family (IPv4 or IPv6) of the two spaces may or may not be the same.  These routes always contain an address family field that specifies whether the customer addresses are IPv4 addresses or whether they are IPv6 addresses.  However, there is no field that explicitly specifies the address family of the provider addresses.  To ensure interoperability, this document specifies that provider IPv4 addresses are always encoded in these update messages as 4-octet addresses, and that the distinction between IPv4 and IPv6 is signaled solely by the length of the address field.

Wildcards in Multicast VPN Auto-

The base specifications for MVPN define BGP multicast VPN auto-discovery routes and specify how to use an auto-discovery route to advertise the fact that an individual customer multicast flow is being carried in a particular tunnel.  However, those specifications do not provide a way to specify, in a single such route, that multiple customer flows are being carried in a single tunnel.  Those specifications also do not provide a way to advertise that a particular tunnel is to be used by default to carry all customer flows, except in the case where that tunnel is joined by all the provider edge routers of the MVPN.  This document eliminates these restrictions by specifying the use of wildcard elements in the customer flow identifiers.  With wildcard elements, a single auto-discovery route can refer to multiple customer flows or even to all customer flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Tree Engineering for Bit Index Explicit

BIER-TE introduces a new semantic for bit positions (BPs). These BPs indicate adjacencies of the network topology, as opposed to (non-TE) BIER in which BPs indicate Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers (BFERs). A BIER-TE packets BitString therefore indicates the edges of the (loop-free) tree across which the packets are forwarded by BIER-TE. BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little changes. Co-existence of BIER and BIER-TE forwarding in the same domain is possible -- for example, by using separate BIER subdomains (SDs). Except for the optional routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing underlay and can therefore operate without depending on a routing protocol such as the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)."];
