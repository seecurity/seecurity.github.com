Native IPv6 behind IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT
Customer Premises Equipment (6a44)
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In customer sites having IPv4-only Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), Teredo (RFC 4380, RFC 5991, RFC 6081) provides last-resort IPv6 connectivity.  However, because it is designed to work without the involvement of Internet Service Providers, it has significant limitations (connectivity between IPv6 native addresses and Teredo addresses is uncertain; connectivity between Teredo addresses fails for some combinations of NAT types).  6a44 is a complementary solution that, being based on ISP cooperation, avoids these limitations.  At the beginning of 6a44 IPv6 addresses, it replaces the Teredo well-known prefix, present at the beginning of Teredo IPv6 addresses, with network-specific /48 prefixes assigned by local ISPs (an evolution similar to that from 6to4 to 6rd (IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures)).  The specification is expected to be complete enough for running code to be independently written and the solution to be incrementally deployed and used.

Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through
Network Address Translations (NATs)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4380.html", target="_top", tooltip="We propose here a service that enables nodes located behind one or more IPv4 Network Address Translations (NATs) to obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling packets over UDP; we call this the Teredo service.  Running the service requires the help of Teredo servers and Teredo relays.  The Teredo servers are stateless, and only have to manage a small fraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the Teredo relays act as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the native IPv6 Internet.  The relays can also provide interoperability with hosts using other transition mechanisms such as 6to4. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Like 6to4, it utilizes stateless IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation in order to transit IPv4-only network infrastructure.  Unlike 6to4, a 6rd service provider uses an IPv6 prefix of its own in place of the fixed 6to4 prefix.  A service provider has used this mechanism for its own IPv6 rapid deployment: five weeks from first exposure to 6rd principles to more than 1,500,000 residential sites being provided native IPv6, under the only condition that they activate it.
