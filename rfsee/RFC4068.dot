Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node to maintain its connectivity to the Internet when moving from one Access Router to another, a process referred to as handover.  During handover, there is a period during which the Mobile Node is unable to send or receive packets because of link switching delay and IP protocol operations.  This handover latency resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures, namely movement detection, new Care of Address configuration, and Binding Update, is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP.  Reducing the handover latency could be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as well.  This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures.  This document does not address improving the link switching latency.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Problem Statement: Dual Stack Mobility

Currently, two mobility management protocols are defined for IPv4 and IPv6.  Deploying both in a dual stack mobile node introduces a number of problems.  Deployment and operational issues motivate the use of a single mobility management protocol.  This document discusses such motivations.  The document also discusses requirements for the Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) and Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol so that they can support mobility management for a dual stack node.
