General Area Review Team (Gen-ART)
Experiences

This document discusses the experience and the lessons learned over the past 7 years of this process.  The review team initially reviewed the I-Ds before each of the IESG telechats.  Since late 2005, review team members have been assigned to review I-Ds during IETF Last Call, unless no IETF Last Call is necessary for the I-D.  The same reviewer then reviews any updates when the I-D is placed on an IESG telechat agenda.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
