Generic Security Service Application
Program Interface (GSS-API)
Authentication and Key Exchange for the
Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network. The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) provides security services to callers in a mechanism-independent fashion. This memo describes methods for using the GSS-API for authentication and key exchange in SSH. It defines an SSH user authentication method that uses a specified GSS-API mechanism to authenticate a user, and a family of SSH key exchange methods that use GSS-API to authenticate a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This memo also defines a new host public key algorithm that can be used when no operations are needed using a host's public key, and a new user authentication method that allows an authorization name to be used in conjunction with any authentication that has already occurred as a side-effect of GSS-API-based key exchange.

On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure
Channels
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5056.html", target="_top", tooltip="The concept of channel binding allows applications to establish that the two end-points of a secure channel at one network layer are the same as at a higher layer by binding authentication at the higher layer to the channel at the lower layer. This allows applications to delegate session protection to lower layers, which has various performance benefits.

Application Bridging for Federated

Most of this effort has focused on two use cases: network access and web-based access. However, the solutions to these use cases that have been proposed and deployed tend to have few building blocks in common. This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non-federated access management, including the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).
