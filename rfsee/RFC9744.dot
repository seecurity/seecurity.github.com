EVPN Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS)
Flexible Cross-Connect (FXC) Service

This new service is referred to as the EVPN-VPWS Flexible Cross-Connect (FXC) service.  This document specifies a solution based on extensions to EVPN-VPWS (RFC 8214), which in turn is based on extensions to EVPN (RFC 7432).

An Architecture for Multi-Segment

Scenarios are discussed where each segment of a given edge-to-edge emulated service spans a different provider's PSN, as are other scenarios where the emulated service originates and terminates on the same provider's PSN, but may pass through several PSN tunnel segments in that PSN.  It presents an architectural framework for such multi-segment pseudowires, defines terminology, and specifies the various protocol elements and their functions.

A Network Virtualization Overlay
Solution Using Ethernet VPN (EVPN)

In particular, the following encapsulation options are analyzed: Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN), Network Virtualization using Generic Routing Encapsulation (NVGRE), and MPLS over GRE.  This specification is also applicable to Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (GENEVE); however, some incremental work is required, which will be covered in a separate document.  This document also specifies new multihoming procedures for split-horizon filtering and mass withdrawal.  It also specifies EVPN route constructions for VXLAN/NVGRE encapsulations and Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) procedures for multihoming of Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) devices."];
