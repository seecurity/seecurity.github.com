Adding Acknowledgement Congestion
Control to TCP
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5690.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a possible congestion control mechanism for acknowledgement (ACKs) traffic in TCP.  The document specifies an end-to-end acknowledgement congestion control mechanism for TCP that uses participation from both TCP hosts: the TCP data sender and the TCP data receiver.  The TCP data sender detects lost or Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)-marked ACK packets, and tells the TCP data receiver the ACK Ratio R to use to respond to the congestion on the reverse path from the data receiver to the data sender.  The TCP data receiver sends roughly one ACK packet for every R data packets received.  This mechanism is based on the acknowledgement congestion control in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol's (DCCP's) Congestion Control Identifier (CCID) 2.  This acknowledgement congestion control mechanism is being specified for further evaluation by the network community.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Byte and Packet Congestion Notification

We give three strong recommendations: (1) packet size should be taken into account when transports detect and respond to congestion indications, (2) packet size should not be taken into account when network equipment creates congestion signals (marking, dropping), and therefore (3) in the specific case of RED, the byte- mode packet drop variant that drops fewer small packets should not be used.  This memo updates RFC 2309 to deprecate deliberate preferential treatment of small packets in AQM algorithms."];

Proportional Integral Controller
Enhanced (PIE): A Lightweight Control
Scheme to Address the Bufferbloat
Problem
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8033.html", target="_top", tooltip="Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the network cause high latency and latency variation. As more and more interactive applications (e.g., voice over IP, real-time video streaming, and financial transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and latency variation degrade application performance. There is a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and latency variation, and hence provide desirable quality of service to users. This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called PIE (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical analysis, and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations. The design does not require per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and is simple enough to implement in both hardware and software."];
