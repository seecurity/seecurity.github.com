Guidelines for Authors of Extensions to
the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

Part of this flexibility is the ease with which it can be extended.  In order to facilitate effective and interoperable extensions to SIP, some guidelines need to be followed when developing SIP extensions.  This document outlines a set of such guidelines for authors of SIP extensions.

Identification of Communications
Services in the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5897.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document considers the problem of service identification in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  Service identification is the process of determining the user-level use case that is driving the signaling being utilized by the user agent (UA).  This document discusses the uses of service identification, and outlines several architectural principles behind the process.  It identifies perils when service identification is not done properly -- including fraud, interoperability failures, and stifling of innovation.  It then outlines a set of recommended practices for service identification.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

SIP-Specific Event Notification
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6665.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) defined by RFC 3261. The purpose of this extension is to provide an extensible framework by which SIP nodes can request notification from remote nodes indicating that certain events have occurred. Note that the event notification mechanisms defined herein are NOT intended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for all classes of event subscription and notification. This document represents a backwards-compatible improvement on the original mechanism described by RFC 3265, taking into account several years of implementation experience. Accordingly, this document obsoletes RFC 3265. This document also updates RFC 4660 slightly to accommodate some small changes to the mechanism that were discussed in that document.

SIP entities that are represented by the URI of the SIP Contact header field can convey media feature tags in the Contact header field to indicate support of features and capabilities.
