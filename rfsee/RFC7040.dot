Public IPv4-over-IPv6 Access Network
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism called Public 4over6, which is designed to provide IPv4 Internet connectivity over an IPv6 access network using global IPv4 addresses.  Public 4over6 was developed in the IETF and is in use in some existing deployments but is not recommended for new deployments.  Future deployments of similar scenarios should use Lightweight 4over6.  Public 4over6 follows the Hub and Spoke softwire model and uses an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to forward IPv4 packets over an IPv6 access network.  The bidirectionality of the IPv4 communication is achieved by explicitly allocating global non-shared IPv4 addresses to end users and by maintaining IPv4-IPv6 address binding on the border relay.  Public 4over6 aims to provide uninterrupted IPv4 services to users, like Internet Content Providers (ICPs), etc., while an operator makes the access network transition to an IPv6-only access network.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Softwire Problem Statement

The standards will encourage multiple, inter-operable vendor implementations by identifying, and extending where necessary, existing standard protocols to resolve a selected set of IPv4/IPv6 and IPv6/IPv4 transition problems.  This document describes the specific problems (Hubs and Spokes and Mesh) that will be solved by the standards developed by the Softwires Working Group.  Some requirements (and non-requirements) are also identified to better describe the specific problem scope.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

This document specifies an extension to DS-Lite called Lightweight 4over6, which moves the Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) function from the centralized DS-Lite tunnel concentrator to the tunnel client located in the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).  This removes the requirement for a Carrier Grade NAT function in the tunnel concentrator and reduces the amount of centralized state that must be held to a per-subscriber level.  In order to delegate the NAPT function and make IPv4 address sharing possible, port-restricted IPv4 addresses are allocated to the CPEs."];
