RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power
and Lossy Networks
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6550.html", target="_top", tooltip="Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which both the routers and their interconnect are constrained.  LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power).  Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability.  LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers.  Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point).  This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported.  Support for point-to-point traffic is also available. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Home Automation Routing Requirements in

In the near future, many homes will contain high numbers of wireless devices for a wide set of purposes.  Examples include actuators (relay, light dimmer, heating valve), sensors (wall switch, water leak, blood pressure), and advanced controllers (radio-frequency-based AV remote control, central server for light and heat control).  Because such devices only cover a limited radio range, routing is often required.  The aim of this document is to specify the routing requirements for networks comprising such constrained devices in a home-control and automation environment.

Routing Requirements for Urban Low-Power
and Lossy Networks
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5548.html", target="_top", tooltip="The application-specific routing requirements for Urban Low-Power and Lossy Networks (U-LLNs) are presented in this document.  In the near future, sensing and actuating nodes will be placed outdoors in urban environments so as to improve people's living conditions as well as to monitor compliance with increasingly strict environmental laws.  These field nodes are expected to measure and report a wide gamut of data (for example, the data required by applications that perform smart-metering or that monitor meteorological, pollution, and allergy conditions).  The majority of these nodes are expected to communicate wirelessly over a variety of links such as IEEE 802.15.4, low-power IEEE 802.11, or IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), which given the limited radio range and the large number of nodes requires the use of suitable routing protocols.  The design of such protocols will be mainly impacted by the limited resources of the nodes (memory, processing power, battery, etc.) and the particularities of the outdoor urban application scenarios.  As such, for a wireless solution for Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy (ROLL) networks to be useful, the protocol(s) ought to be energy-efficient, scalable, and autonomous.  This documents aims to specify a set of IPv6 routing requirements reflecting these and further U-LLNs' tailored characteristics.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

A simple suppression mechanism and transmission point selection allow Trickle's communication rate to scale logarithmically with density.
