Host Mobility with the Host Identity
Protocol

Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2)
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7401.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes. HIP is based on a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication. The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. When used together with another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional encryption for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP. This document obsoletes RFC 5201 and addresses the concerns raised by the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility. It also incorporates lessons learned from the implementations of RFC 5201."];

NAT and Firewall Traversal Issues of
Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
Communication
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5207.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) changes the way in which two Internet hosts communicate.  One key advantage over other schemes is that HIP does not require modifications to the traditional network- layer functionality of the Internet, i.e., its routers.  In the current Internet, however, many devices other than routers modify the traditional network-layer behavior of the Internet.  These middleboxes are intermediary devices that perform functions other than the standard functions of an IP router on the datagram path between source and destination hosts.  Whereas some types of middleboxes may not interfere with HIP at all, others can affect some aspects of HIP communication, and others can render HIP communication impossible.  This document discusses the problems associated with HIP communication across network paths that include specific types of middleboxes, namely, network address translators and firewalls.  It identifies and discusses issues in the current HIP specifications that affect communication across these types of middleboxes.  This document is a product of the IRTF HIP Research Group.

Internet of Things (IoT) Security: State
of the Art and Challenges
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8576.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication. The security needs for IoT systems are well recognized, and many standardization steps to provide security have been taken -- for example, the specification of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) secured with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). However, security challenges still exist, not only because there are some use cases that lack a suitable solution, but also because many IoT devices and systems have been designed and deployed with very limited security capabilities. In this document, we first discuss the various stages in the lifecycle of a thing. Next, we document the security threats to a thing and the challenges that one might face to protect against these threats. Lastly, we discuss the next steps needed to facilitate the deployment of secure IoT systems. This document can be used by implementers and authors of IoT specifications as a reference for details about security considerations while documenting their specific security challenges, threat models, and mitigations.
