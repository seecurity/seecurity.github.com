RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time
Applications
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3550.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for
Unicast Secure RTP
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6189.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines ZRTP, a protocol for media path Diffie-Hellman exchange to agree on a session key and parameters for establishing unicast Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) sessions for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.  The ZRTP protocol is media path keying because it is multiplexed on the same port as RTP and does not require support in the signaling protocol.  ZRTP does not assume a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or require the complexity of certificates in end devices.  For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication.  ZRTP can utilize a Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication through the signaling channel.  To provide best effort SRTP, ZRTP utilizes normal RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) profiles.  ZRTP secures media sessions that include a voice media stream and can also secure media sessions that do not include voice by using an optional digital signature.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
