Flow-Binding Support for Mobile IP
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This specification defines extensions to the Mobile IP protocol for allowing a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-of address for each of its network interfaces and to simultaneously establish multiple IP tunnels with its home agent.  This essentially allows the mobile node to utilize all the available network interfaces and build a higher aggregated logical pipe with its home agent for its home address traffic.  Furthermore, these extensions also allow the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate IP traffic flow policies for binding individual flows with the registered care-of addresses.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

IP Mobility Support for IPv4, Revised
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5944.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent routing of IP datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about its current point of attachment to the Internet.  The protocol provides for registering the care-of address with a home agent.  The home agent sends datagrams destined for the mobile node through a tunnel to the care-of address.  After arriving at the end of the tunnel, each datagram is then delivered to the mobile node. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA. This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
