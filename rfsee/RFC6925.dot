The DHCPv4 Relay Agent Identifier Sub-

DHCP Relay Agent Information Option
2001", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3046.html", target="_top", tooltip="Newer high-speed public Internet access technologies call for a high- speed modem to have a local area network (LAN) attachment to one or more customer premise hosts.  It is advantageous to use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) as defined in RFC 2131 to assign customer premise host IP addresses in this environment.  However, a number of security and scaling problems arise with such public DHCP use.  This document describes a new DHCP option to address these issues.  This option extends the set of DHCP options as defined in RFC 2132. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
