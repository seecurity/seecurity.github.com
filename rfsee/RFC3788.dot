Security Considerations for Signaling
Transport (SIGTRAN) Protocols

The main goal is to recommend the minimum security means that a SIGTRAN node must implement in order to attain secured communication.  The support of IPsec is mandatory for all nodes running SIGTRAN protocols.  TLS support is optional. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Signaling System 7 (SS7) Message
Transfer Part 2 (MTP2) - User Peer-to-
Peer Adaptation Layer (M2PA)
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4165.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a protocol supporting the transport of Signaling System Number 7 (SS7) Message Transfer Part (MTP) Level 3 signaling messages over Internet Protocol (IP) using the services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  This protocol would be used between SS7 Signaling Points using the MTP Level 3 protocol.  The SS7 Signaling Points may also use standard SS7 links using the SS7 MTP Level 2 to provide transport of MTP Level 3 signaling messages.  The protocol operates in a manner similar to MTP Level 2 so as to provide peer-to-peer communication between SS7 endpoints. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
