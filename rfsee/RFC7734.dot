Support for Shortest Path Bridging MAC
Mode over Ethernet VPN (EVPN)
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes how Ethernet Shortest Path Bridging MAC mode (SPBM) can be combined with Ethernet VPN (EVPN) to interwork with Provider Backbone Bridging Provider Edges (PBB PEs) as described in the PBB-EVPN solution (RFC 7623).  This is achieved via operational isolation of each Ethernet network attached to an EVPN core while supporting full interworking between the different variations of Ethernet networks."];

IS-IS Extensions Supporting IEEE 802.1aq
Shortest Path Bridging
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6329.html", target="_top", tooltip="802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) has been standardized by the IEEE as the next step in the evolution of the various spanning tree and registration protocols.  802.1aq allows for true shortest path forwarding in a mesh Ethernet network context utilizing multiple equal cost paths.  This permits it to support much larger Layer 2 topologies, with faster convergence, and vastly improved use of the mesh topology.  Combined with this is single point provisioning for logical connectivity membership, which includes point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-multipoint variations.  This memo documents the IS-IS changes required to support this IEEE protocol and provides some context and examples. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
