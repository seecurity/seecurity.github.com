IMS is part of Release 5 of the 3GPP specifications.  Although SIP is a protocol that fulfills most of the requirements for establishing a session in an IP network, SIP has never been evaluated against the specific 3GPP requirements for operation in a cellular network.  In this document, we express the requirements identified by 3GPP to support SIP for Release 5 of the 3GPP IMS in cellular networks.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
