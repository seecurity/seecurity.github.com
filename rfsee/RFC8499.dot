DNS Glue Requirements in Referral
Responses
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9471.html", target="_top", tooltip="The DNS uses glue records to allow iterative clients to find the addresses of name servers that are contained within a delegated zone.  Authoritative servers are expected to return all available glue records for in-domain name servers in a referral response.  If message size constraints prevent the inclusion of all glue records for in-domain name servers, the server must set the TC (Truncated) flag to inform the client that the response is incomplete and that the client should use another transport to retrieve the full response.  This document updates RFC 1034 to clarify correct server behavior."];

The GNU Name System
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9498.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides the GNU Name System (GNS) technical specification. GNS is a decentralized and censorship-resistant domain name resolution protocol that provides a privacy-enhancing alternative to the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. This document defines the normative wire format of resource records, resolution processes, cryptographic routines, and security and privacy considerations for use by implementers. This specification was developed outside the IETF and does not have IETF consensus. It is published here to inform readers about the function of GNS, guide future GNS implementations, and ensure interoperability among implementations (for example, pre-existing GNUnet implementations)."];

DNS Terminology
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9499.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Domain Name System (DNS) is defined in literally dozens of different RFCs. The terminology used by implementers and developers of DNS protocols, and by operators of DNS systems, has changed in the decades since the DNS was first defined. This document gives current definitions for many of the terms used in the DNS in a single document. This document updates RFC 2308 by clarifying the definitions of forwarder and QNAME. It obsoletes RFC 8499 by adding multiple terms and clarifications. Comprehensive lists of changed and new definitions can be found in Appendices A and B."];

Simple Provisioning of Public Names for
Residential Networks
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9526.html", target="_top", tooltip="Home network owners may have devices or services hosted on their home network that they wish to access from the Internet (i.e., from a network outside of the home network). Home networks are increasingly numbered using IPv6 addresses, which in principle makes this access simpler, but accessing home networks from the Internet requires the names and IP addresses of these devices and services to be made available in the public DNS. This document describes how a Home Naming Authority (NHA) instructs the outsourced infrastructure to publish these pieces of information in the public DNS. The names and IP addresses of the home network are set in the Public Homenet Zone by the Homenet Naming Authority (HNA), which in turn instructs an outsourced infrastructure to publish the zone on behalf of the home network owner."];
