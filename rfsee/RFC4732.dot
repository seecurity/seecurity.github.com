Operational Neighbor Discovery Problems

Consequently, simplistic implementations of Neighbor Discovery (ND) can be vulnerable to deliberate or accidental denial of service (DoS), whereby they attempt to perform address resolution for large numbers of unassigned addresses. Such denial-of-service attacks can be launched intentionally (by an attacker) or result from legitimate operational tools or accident conditions.

The process of resolution may result in one of three types of responses: (1) a response containing the requested data, (2) a response indicating the requested data does not exist, or (3) a non-response due to a resolution failure in which the resolver does not receive any useful information regarding the data's existence. This document concerns itself only with the third type. RFC 2308 specifies requirements for DNS negative caching. There, caching of TYPE 2 responses is mandatory and caching of TYPE 3 responses is optional. This document updates RFC 2308 to require negative caching for DNS resolution failures. RFC 4035 allows DNSSEC validation failure caching. This document updates RFC 4035 to require caching for DNSSEC validation failures. RFC 4697 prohibits aggressive requerying for NS records at a failed zone's parent zone. This document updates RFC 4697 to expand this requirement to all query types and to all ancestor zones."];

Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9639.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) format and its streamable subset.  FLAC is designed to reduce the amount of computer storage space needed to store digital audio signals.  It does this losslessly, i.e., it does so without losing information.  FLAC is free in the sense that its specification is open and its reference implementation is open source.  Compared to other lossless audio coding formats, FLAC is a format with low complexity and can be encoded and decoded with little computing resources.  Decoding of FLAC has been implemented independently for many different platforms, and both encoding and decoding can be implemented without needing floating-point arithmetic."];
