Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4724.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize the negative effects on routing caused by BGP restart. An End-of-RIB marker is specified and can be used to convey routing convergence information. A new BGP capability, termed Graceful Restart Capability, is defined that would allow a BGP speaker to express its ability to preserve forwarding state during BGP restart. Finally, procedures are outlined for temporarily retaining routing information across a TCP session termination/re-establishment. The mechanisms described in this document are applicable to all routers, both those with the ability to preserve forwarding state during BGP restart and those without (although the latter need to implement only a subset of the mechanisms described in this document).

A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4271.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol. The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network class within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. This document obsoletes RFC 1771. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8126.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters. To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry. This is the third edition of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226."];

Long-Lived Graceful Restart for BGP
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9494.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document introduces a BGP capability called the Long-Lived Graceful Restart Capability (or LLGR Capability). The benefit of this capability is that stale routes can be retained for a longer time upon session failure than is provided for by BGP Graceful Restart (as described in RFC 4724). A well-known BGP community called LLGR_STALE is introduced for marking stale routes retained for a longer time. A second well-known BGP community called NO_LLGR is introduced for marking routes for which these procedures should not be applied. We also specify that such long-lived stale routes be treated as the least preferred and that their advertisements be limited to BGP speakers that have advertised the capability. Use of this extension is not advisable in all cases, and we provide guidelines to help determine if it is. This memo updates RFC 6368 by specifying that the LLGR_STALE community must be propagated into, or out of, the path attributes exchanged between the Provider Edge (PE) and Customer Edge (CE) routers."];
