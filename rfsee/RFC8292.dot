Voluntary Application Server
Identification (VAPID) for Web Push
2017", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="An application server can use the Voluntary Application Server Identification (VAPID) method described in this document to voluntarily identify itself to a push service.  The vapid authentication scheme allows a client to include its identity in a signed token with requests that it makes.  The signature can be used by the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server to a single entity.  The identification information can allow the operator of a push service to contact the operator of the application server.  The signature can be used to restrict the use of a push message subscription to a single application server."];

To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed.
