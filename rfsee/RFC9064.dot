Considerations in the Development of a
QoS Architecture for CCNx-Like
Information-Centric Networking Protocols
2021", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This is a position paper. It documents the author's personal views on how Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities ought to be accommodated in Information-Centric Networking (ICN) protocols like Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) or Named Data Networking (NDN), which employ flow-balanced Interest/Data exchanges and hop-by-hop forwarding state as their fundamental machinery. It argues that such protocols demand a substantially different approach to QoS from that taken in TCP/IP and proposes specific design patterns to achieve both classification and differentiated QoS treatment on both a flow and aggregate basis. It also considers the effect of caches in addition to memory, CPU, and link bandwidth as resources that should be subject to explicitly unfair resource allocation. The proposed methods are intended to operate purely at the network layer, providing the primitives needed to achieve transport- and higher-layer QoS objectives. It explicitly excludes any discussion of Quality of Experience (QoE), which can only be assessed and controlled at the application layer or above.

Content-Centric Networking (CCNx)
Semantics
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8569.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the core concepts of the Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) architecture and presents a network protocol based on two messages: Interests and Content Objects. It specifies the set of mandatory and optional fields within those messages and describes their behavior and interpretation. This architecture and protocol specification is independent of a specific wire encoding. The protocol also uses a control message called an Interest Return, whereby one system can return an Interest message to the previous hop due to an error condition. This indicates to the previous hop that the current system will not respond to the Interest. This document is a product of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).

It offers the following services to its users: -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data, -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size, -- sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages, -- optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association. The design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Experimental Scenarios of Information-

4G Mobile Networks
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9269.html", target="_top", tooltip="A 4G mobile network uses IP-based transport for the control plane to establish the data session at the user plane for the actual data delivery.  In the existing architecture, IP-based unicast is used for the delivery of multimedia content to a mobile terminal, where each user is receiving a separate stream from the server.  From a bandwidth and routing perspective, this approach is inefficient.  Evolved multimedia broadcast and multicast service (eMBMS) provides capabilities for delivering contents to multiple users simultaneously, but its deployment is very limited or at an experimental stage due to numerous challenges.  The focus of this document is to list the options for using Information-Centric Networking (ICN) in 4G mobile networks and elaborate the experimental setups for its further evaluation.  The experimental setups discussed provide guidance for using ICN either natively or with an existing mobility protocol stack.  With further investigations based on the listed experiments, ICN with its inherent capabilities such as network-layer multicast, anchorless mobility, security, and optimized data delivery using local caching at the edge may provide a viable alternative to IP transport in 4G mobile networks."];
