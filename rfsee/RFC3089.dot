TCP Candidates with Interactive

2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6544.html", target="_top", tooltip="Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines a mechanism for NAT traversal for multimedia communication protocols based on the offer/answer model of session negotiation.  ICE works by providing a set of candidate transport addresses for each media stream, which are then validated with peer-to-peer connectivity checks based on Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN).  ICE provides a general framework for describing candidates but only defines UDP-based media streams.  This specification extends ICE to TCP-based media, including the ability to offer a mix of TCP and UDP-based candidates for a single stream. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
