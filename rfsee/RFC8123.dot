Requirements for Marking SIP Messages to
be Logged
2017", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="SIP networks use signaling monitoring tools to debug customer- reported problems and for regression testing if network or client software is upgraded. As networks grow and become interconnected, including connection via transit networks, it becomes impractical to predict the path that SIP signaling will take between clients and, therefore, impractical to monitor SIP signaling end-to-end. This document describes the requirements for adding an indicator to the SIP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) or a SIP message that marks the PDU as a candidate for logging. Such a marking will typically be applied as part of network testing controlled by the network operator and not used in regular client signaling. However, such a marking can be carried end-to-end, including the SIP terminals, even if a session originates and terminates in different networks.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

The goal of this document is to describe the commonly provided functions of SBCs.  A special focus is given to those practices that are viewed to be in conflict with SIP architectural principles.  This document also explores the underlying requirements of network operators that have led to the use of these functions and practices in order to identify protocol requirements and determine whether those requirements are satisfied by existing specifications or if additional standards work is required.

A Taxonomy of Session Initiation

The only term for such devices provided in RFC 3261 is for a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), which is defined as the logical concatenation of a SIP User Agent Server (UAS) and User Agent Client (UAC). There are numerous types of SIP B2BUAs performing different roles in different ways; for example, IP Private Branch Exchanges (IPBXs), Session Border Controllers (SBCs), and Application Servers (ASs). This document identifies several common B2BUA roles in order to provide taxonomy other documents can use and reference."];
