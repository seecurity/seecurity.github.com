Issues and Requirements for Server Name
Identification (SNI) Encryption in TLS
2020", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the general problem of encrypting the Server Name Identification (SNI) TLS parameter. The proposed solutions hide a hidden service behind a fronting service, only disclosing the SNI of the fronting service to external observers. This document lists known attacks against SNI encryption, discusses the current HTTP co-tenancy solution, and presents requirements for future TLS-layer solutions. In practice, it may well be that no solution can meet every requirement and that practical solutions will have to make some compromises."];
