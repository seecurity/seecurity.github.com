Internet Small Computer Systems
Interface (iSCSI)

The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with the standardized SCSI architecture model.  SCSI is a popular family of protocols that enable systems to communicate with I/O devices, especially storage devices.  SCSI protocols are request/response application protocols with a common standardized architecture model and basic command set, as well as standardized command sets for different device classes (disks, tapes, media-changers etc.).  As system interconnects move from the classical bus structure to a network structure, SCSI has to be mapped to network transport protocols.  IP networks now meet the performance requirements of fast system interconnects and as such are good candidates to carry SCSI. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the- middle (MitM) attacks.

This document is a snapshot of IPsec- and IKE-related RFCs. It includes a brief description of each RFC, along with background information explaining the motivation and context of IPsec's outgrowths and extensions. It obsoletes RFC 2411, the previous IP Security Document Roadmap. The obsoleted IPsec roadmap (RFC 2411) briefly described the interrelationship of the various classes of base IPsec documents. The major focus of RFC 2411 was to specify the recommended contents of documents specifying additional encryption and authentication algorithms.
