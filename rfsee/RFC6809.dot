Managing Client-Initiated Connections in

2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5626.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to initiate TCP connections or to send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User Agents in order to deliver requests.  However, in a large number of real deployments, many practical considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs) or the use of TLS with server-provided certificates, prevent servers from connecting to User Agents in this way.  This specification defines behaviors for User Agents, registrars, and proxy servers that allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent.  It also defines keep-alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple connections from the User Agent to its registrar. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.

A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Response Code for Rejected Calls
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8688.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the 608 (Rejected) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) response code.  This response code enables calling parties to learn that an intermediary rejected their call attempt.  No one will deliver, and thus answer, the call.  As a 6xx code, the caller will be aware that future attempts to contact the same User Agent Server will likely fail.  The initial use case driving the need for the 608 response code is when the intermediary is an analytics engine.  In this case, the rejection is by a machine or other process.  This contrasts with the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response code in which a human at the target User Agent Server indicates the user did not want the call.  In some jurisdictions, this distinction is important.  This document also defines the use of the Call-Info header field in 608 responses to enable rejected callers to contact entities that blocked their calls in error.  This provides a remediation mechanism for legal callers that find their calls blocked."];
