Default Address Selection for Internet
Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)

The algorithms specify default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations. They do not override choices made by applications or upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the development of more advanced mechanisms for address selection. The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior. In dual-stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses -- depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice versa. Default address selection as defined in this specification applies to all IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers. This document obsoletes RFC 3484. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Native IPv6 behind IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT
Customer Premises Equipment (6a44)

However, because it is designed to work without the involvement of Internet Service Providers, it has significant limitations (connectivity between IPv6 native addresses and Teredo addresses is uncertain; connectivity between Teredo addresses fails for some combinations of NAT types).  6a44 is a complementary solution that, being based on ISP cooperation, avoids these limitations.  At the beginning of 6a44 IPv6 addresses, it replaces the Teredo well-known prefix, present at the beginning of Teredo IPv6 addresses, with network-specific /48 prefixes assigned by local ISPs (an evolution similar to that from 6to4 to 6rd (IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures)).  The specification is expected to be complete enough for running code to be independently written and the solution to be incrementally deployed and used.

Network Reconnaissance in IPv6 Networks

As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a tremendous effort to perform address-scanning attacks against IPv6 networks; therefore, IPv6 address-scanning attacks have been considered unfeasible.

Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic. They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP. Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion control.
