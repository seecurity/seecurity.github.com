A domain owner or DNS hosting organization can use these reports to improve domain hosting. The reports are based on extended DNS errors as described in RFC 8914. When a domain name fails to resolve or validate due to a misconfiguration or an attack, the operator of the authoritative server may be unaware of this. To mitigate this lack of feedback, this document describes a method for a validating resolver to automatically signal an error to a monitoring agent specified by the authoritative server. The error is encoded in the QNAME; thus, the very act of sending the query is to report the error."];

IP Fragmentation Avoidance in DNS over
UDP
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9715.html", target="_top", tooltip="The widely deployed Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0)) feature in the DNS enables a DNS receiver to indicate its received UDP message size capacity, which supports the sending of large UDP responses by a DNS server.  Large DNS/UDP messages are more likely to be fragmented, and IP fragmentation has exposed weaknesses in application protocols.  It is possible to avoid IP fragmentation in DNS by limiting the response size where possible and signaling the need to upgrade from UDP to TCP transport where necessary.  This document describes techniques to avoid IP fragmentation in DNS."];
