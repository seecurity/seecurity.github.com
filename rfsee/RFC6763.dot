This document describes three such mechanisms for TURN server discovery. This document updates RFC 5766 to relax the requirement for mutual authentication in certain cases."];

Selecting Labels for Use with

Systems in DNS-Based Service Discovery
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8222.html", target="_top", tooltip="Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) can use naming systems other than DNS when looking for services.  Moreover, when it uses DNS, DNS-SD uses the full capability of DNS, rather than using a subset of available octets.  This is of particular relevance where some environments use DNS labels that conform to Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA), and other environments use labels containing Unicode characters (such as containing octets corresponding to characters encoded as UTF-8).  In order for DNS-SD to be used effectively in environments where multiple different name systems and conventions for their operation are in use, it is important to attend to differences in the underlying technology and operational environment.  This memo presents an outline of the requirements for the selection of labels for conventional DNS and other resolution systems when they are expected to interoperate in this manner."];

Scoped Interpretation of DNS Resource

2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8552.html", target="_top", tooltip="Formally, any DNS Resource Record (RR) may occur under any domain name.  However, some services use an operational convention for defining specific interpretations of an RRset by locating the records in a DNS branch under the parent domain to which the RRset actually applies.  The top of this subordinate branch is defined by a naming convention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with the underscore character (e.g., _name).  The underscored naming construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent domain above the underscored branch.  This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names registry with IANA.  The purpose of this registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the use of the same underscored name for different services."];
