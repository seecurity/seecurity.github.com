The BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address
Family Identifier (SAFI) and the BGP
Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute
2009", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In certain situations, transporting a packet from one Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) speaker to another (the BGP next hop) requires that the packet be encapsulated by the first BGP speaker and decapsulated by the second. To support these situations, there needs to be some agreement between the two BGP speakers with regard to the encapsulation information, i.e., the format of the encapsulation header as well as the contents of various fields of the header. The encapsulation information need not be signaled for all encapsulation types. In cases where signaling is required (such as Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) with key), this document specifies a method by which BGP speakers can signal encapsulation information to each other. The signaling is done by sending BGP updates using the Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) and the IPv4 or IPv6 Address Family Identifier (AFI). In cases where no encapsulation information needs to be signaled (such as GRE without key), this document specifies a BGP extended community that can be attached to BGP UPDATE messages that carry payload prefixes in order to indicate the encapsulation protocol type to be used.

A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4271.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol. The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network class within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. This document obsoletes RFC 1771. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Softwire Mesh Framework
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5565.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet needs to be able to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  However, it is expected that some constituent networks of the Internet will be single-protocol networks.  One kind of single-protocol network can parse only IPv4 packets and can process only IPv4 routing information; another kind can parse only IPv6 packets and can process only IPv6 routing information.  It is nevertheless required that either kind of single-protocol network be able to provide transit service for the other protocol.  This is done by passing the other kind of routing information from one edge of the single-protocol network to the other, and by tunneling the other kind of data packet from one edge to the other.  The tunnels are known as softwires.  This framework document explains how the routing information and the data packets of one protocol are passed through a single-protocol network of the other protocol.  The document is careful to specify when this can be done with existing technology and when it requires the development of new or modified technology. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Load-Balancing for Mesh Softwires
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5640.html", target="_top", tooltip="Payloads transported over a Softwire mesh service (as defined by BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) information exchange) often carry a number of identifiable, distinct flows.  It can, in some circumstances, be desirable to distribute these flows over the equal cost multiple paths (ECMPs) that exist in the packet switched network.  Currently, the payload of a packet entering the Softwire can only be interpreted by the ingress and egress routers.  Thus, the load-balancing decision of a core router is only based on the encapsulating header, presenting much less entropy than available in the payload or the encapsulated header since the Softwire encapsulation acts in a tunneling fashion.  This document describes a method for achieving comparable load-balancing efficiency in a network carrying Softwire mesh service over Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) over IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) encapsulation to what would be achieved without such encapsulation.
