Analysis on IPv6 Transition in Third

These networks are based on General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology, and the radio network architecture is based on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)/Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technology. The focus is on analyzing different transition scenarios and applicable transition mechanisms and finding solutions for those transition scenarios. In these scenarios, the User Equipment (UE) connects to other nodes, e.g., in the Internet, and IPv6/IPv4 transition mechanisms are needed.

NAT and Firewall Traversal Issues of
Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
Communication
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5207.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) changes the way in which two Internet hosts communicate.  One key advantage over other schemes is that HIP does not require modifications to the traditional network- layer functionality of the Internet, i.e., its routers.  In the current Internet, however, many devices other than routers modify the traditional network-layer behavior of the Internet.  These middleboxes are intermediary devices that perform functions other than the standard functions of an IP router on the datagram path between source and destination hosts.  Whereas some types of middleboxes may not interfere with HIP at all, others can affect some aspects of HIP communication, and others can render HIP communication impossible.  This document discusses the problems associated with HIP communication across network paths that include specific types of middleboxes, namely, network address translators and firewalls.  It identifies and discusses issues in the current HIP specifications that affect communication across these types of middleboxes.  This document is a product of the IRTF HIP Research Group.
