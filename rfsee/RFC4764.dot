The EAP-PSK Protocol: A Pre-Shared Key
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
Method
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies EAP-PSK, an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method for mutual authentication and session key derivation using a Pre-Shared Key (PSK).  EAP-PSK provides a protected communication channel when mutual authentication is successful for both parties to communicate over.  This document describes the use of this channel only for protected exchange of result indications, but future EAP-PSK extensions may use the channel for other purposes.  EAP-PSK is designed for authentication over insecure networks such as IEEE 802.11.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Authentication Service Based on the

for Use with the Constrained Application
Protocol (CoAP)
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9820.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies an authentication service that uses the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as a transport method to carry the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).  As such, it defines an EAP lower layer based on CoAP called CoAP-EAP.  One of the main goals is to authenticate a CoAP-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) device (EAP peer) that intends to join a security domain managed by a Controller (EAP authenticator).  Secondly, it allows deriving key material to protect CoAP messages exchanged between them based on Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), enabling the establishment of a security association between them."];
