Content Attribute

The 'content' attribute defines the content of the media stream to a more detailed level than the media description line.  The sender of an SDP session description can attach the 'content' attribute to one or more media streams.  The receiving application can then treat each media stream differently (e.g., show it on a big or small screen) based on its content. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
