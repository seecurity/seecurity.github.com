Using LDP Multipoint Extensions on
Targeted LDP Sessions
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths.  However, the specification for the Multipoint Extensions to LDP presupposes that the two endpoints of an LDP session are directly connected.  The LDP base specification allows for the case where the two endpoints of an LDP session are not directly connected; such a session is known as a Targeted LDP session.  This document provides the specification for using the LDP Multipoint Extensions over a Targeted LDP session."];

Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol
In-Band Signaling in a Virtual Routing
and Forwarding (VRF) Table Context
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7246.html", target="_top", tooltip="An IP Multicast Distribution Tree (MDT) may traverse both label switching (i.e., Multiprotocol Label Switching, or MPLS) and non-label switching regions of a network.  Typically, the MDT begins and ends in non-MPLS regions, but travels through an MPLS region.  In such cases, it can be useful to begin building the MDT as a pure IP MDT, then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path (MP-LSP) when it enters an MPLS-enabled region, and then convert it back to a pure IP MDT when it enters a non-MPLS-enabled region.  Other documents specify the procedures for building such a hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) in the non-MPLS region of the network, and using Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol (mLDP) in the MPLS region.  This document extends those procedures to handle the case where the link connecting the two regions is a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) table link, as defined in the BGP IP/MPLS VPN specification.  However, this document is primarily aimed at particular use cases where VRFs are used to support multicast applications other than multicast VPN."];

Multipoint LDP (mLDP) Node Protection

In order to protect a node N, the Point of Local Repair (PLR) Label Switching Router (LSR) of N must learn the Merge Point (MPT) LSR(s) of node N such that traffic can be redirected to them in case node N fails.  Redirecting the traffic around the failed node N depends on existing Point-to-Point (P2P) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  The pre-established LSPs originate from the PLR LSR and terminate on the MPT LSRs while bypassing LSR N."];
