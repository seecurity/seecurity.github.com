The proposed solutions this document are not intended as standards for the Internet at this time.  Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solution to authentication problems, leading eventually to the adoption of standards.  This document suggests mediated access-control and authentication procedures suitable for those cases when an association is to be set up between users belonging to different trust environments.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
