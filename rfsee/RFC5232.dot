Sieve Email Filtering: Imap4flags
Extension
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Recent discussions have shown that it is desirable to set different IMAP (RFC 3501) flags on message delivery. This can be done, for example, by a Sieve interpreter that works as a part of a Mail Delivery Agent. This document describes an extension to the Sieve mail filtering language for setting IMAP flags. The extension allows setting of both IMAP system flags and IMAP keywords. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

The ihave extension provides a means to write scripts that can take advantage of optional Sieve features but can still run when those optional features are not available.

Sieve Email Filtering:  Sieves and
Display Directives in XML

Representing Sieves in XML is intended not as an alternate storage format for Sieve but rather as a means to facilitate manipulation of scripts using XML tools. The XML representation also defines additional elements that have no counterparts in the regular Sieve language. These elements are intended for use by graphical user interfaces and provide facilities for labeling or grouping sections of a script so they can be displayed more conveniently. These elements are represented as specially structured comments in regular Sieve format. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

As defined in the base specification, it plugs into mail delivery.  This document defines how Sieve can plug into points in IMAP where messages are created or changed, adding the option of user-defined or installation-defined filtering (or, with Sieve extensions, features such as notifications).  Because this requires future Sieve extensions to specify their interactions with this one, this document updates the base Sieve specification, RFC 5228. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
