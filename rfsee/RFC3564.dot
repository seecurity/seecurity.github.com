Requirements for Support of
Differentiated Services-aware MPLS
Traffic Engineering
2003", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document presents Service Provider requirements for support of Differentiated Services (Diff-Serv)-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS- TE).  Its objective is to provide guidance for the definition, selection and specification of a technical solution addressing these requirements.  Specification for this solution itself is outside the scope of this document.  A problem statement is first provided.  Then, the document describes example applications scenarios identified by Service Providers where existing MPLS Traffic Engineering mechanisms fall short and Diff-Serv-aware Traffic Engineering can address the needs.  The detailed requirements that need to be addressed by the technical solution are also reviewed.  Finally, the document identifies the evaluation criteria that should be considered for selection and definition of the technical solution.

Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
Label Stack Entry: EXP Field Renamed to

Although the intended use of the EXP field was as a Class of Service (CoS) field, it was not named a CoS field by these early documents because the use of such a CoS field was not considered to be sufficiently defined. Today a number of standards documents define its usage as a CoS field. To avoid misunderstanding about how this field may be used, it has become increasingly necessary to rename this field.

Signaling Requirements for Point-to-

There is no intent to specify solution-specific details or application-specific requirements in this document. The requirements presented in this document not only apply to packet-switched networks under the control of MPLS protocols, but also encompass the requirements of Layer Two Switching (L2SC), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), lambda, and port switching networks managed by Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocols. Protocol solutions developed to meet the requirements set out in this document must attempt to be equally applicable to MPLS and GMPLS. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Label Switched Path (LSP) Preemption
Policies for MPLS Traffic Engineering
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4829.html", target="_top", tooltip="When the establishment of a higher priority (Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path) TE LSP requires the preemption of a set of lower priority TE LSPs, a node has to make a local decision to select which TE LSPs will be preempted.  The preempted LSPs are then rerouted by their respective \%Head-end Label Switch Router (LSR).  This document presents a flexible policy that can be used to achieve different objectives: preempt the lowest priority LSPs; preempt the minimum number of LSPs; preempt the set of TE LSPs that provide the closest amount of bandwidth to the required bandwidth for the preempting TE LSPs (to minimize bandwidth wastage); preempt the LSPs that will have the maximum chance to get rerouted.  Simulation results are given and a comparison among several different policies, with respect to preemption cascading, number of preempted LSPs, priority, wasted bandwidth and blocking probability is also included.

QSPEC Template for the Quality-of-

2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5975.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Quality-of-Service (QoS) NSIS signaling layer protocol (NSLP) is used to signal QoS reservations and is independent of a specific QoS model (QOSM) such as IntServ or Diffserv.  Rather, all information specific to a QOSM is encapsulated in a separate object, the QSPEC.  This document defines a template for the QSPEC including a number of QSPEC parameters.  The QSPEC parameters provide a common language to be reused in several QOSMs and thereby aim to ensure the extensibility and interoperability of QoS NSLP.  While the base protocol is QOSM-agnostic, the parameters that can be carried in the QSPEC object are possibly closely coupled to specific models.  The node initiating the NSIS signaling adds an Initiator QSPEC, which indicates the QSPEC parameters that must be interpreted by the downstream nodes less the reservation fails, thereby ensuring the intention of the NSIS initiator is preserved along the signaling path.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];
