Network Mobility Support Goals and
Requirements
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Network mobility arises when a router connecting a network to the Internet dynamically changes its point of attachment to the Internet thereby causing the reachability of the said network to be changed in relation to the fixed Internet topology.  Such a type of network is referred to as a mobile network.  With appropriate mechanisms, sessions established between nodes in the mobile network and the global Internet can be maintained after the mobile router changes its point of attachment.  This document outlines the goals expected from network mobility support and defines the requirements that must be met by the NEMO Basic Support solution.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support
Protocol
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3963.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support protocol that enables Mobile Networks to attach to different points in the Internet.  The protocol is an extension of Mobile IPv6 and allows session continuity for every node in the Mobile Network as the network moves.  It also allows every node in the Mobile Network to be reachable while moving around.  The Mobile Router, which connects the network to the Internet, runs the NEMO Basic Support protocol with its Home Agent.  The protocol is designed so that network mobility is transparent to the nodes inside the Mobile Network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
