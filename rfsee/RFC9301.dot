Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult.

A fundamental property of LISP-speaking sites is that they use Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), rather than traditional IP addresses, in the source and destination fields of all traffic they emit or receive.  While EIDs are syntactically identical to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, normally routes to them are not carried in the global routing system, so an interoperability mechanism is needed for non- LISP-speaking sites to exchange traffic with LISP-speaking sites.  This document introduces three such mechanisms.  The first uses a new network element, the LISP Proxy Ingress Tunnel Router (Proxy-ITR), to act as an intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) for non-LISP- speaking hosts.

LDACS is a scheduled and reliable multi-application cellular broadband system with support for IPv6.  It is part of a larger shift of flight guidance communication moving to IP-based communication.  High reliability and availability of IP connectivity over LDACS, as well as security, are therefore essential.  The intent of this document is to introduce LDACS to the IETF community, raise awareness on related activities inside and outside of the IETF, and to seek expertise in shaping the shift of aeronautics to IP."];
