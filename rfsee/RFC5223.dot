Discovering Location-to-Service

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP)
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol describes an XML- based protocol for mapping service identifiers and geospatial or civic location information to service contact Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). LoST servers can be located anywhere, but a placement closer to the end host, e.g., in the access network, is desirable. In disaster situations with intermittent network connectivity, such a LoST server placement provides benefits regarding the resiliency of emergency service communication. This document describes how a LoST client can discover a LoST server using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
