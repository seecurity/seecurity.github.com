Synchronization Operations for
Disconnected IMAP4 Clients
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document attempts to address some of the issues involved in building a disconnected IMAP4 client. In particular, it deals with the issues of what might be called the driver portion of the synchronization tool: the portion of the code responsible for issuing the correct set of IMAP4 commands to synchronize the disconnected client in the way that is most likely to make the human who uses the disconnected client happy. This note describes different strategies that can be used by disconnected clients and shows how to use IMAP protocol in order to minimize the time of the synchronization process. This note also lists IMAP extensions that a server should implement in order to provide better synchronization facilities to disconnected clients.

IMAP4 Implementation Recommendations

Because the protocol is so rich and has so many implementation choices, there are often trade-offs that must be made and issues that must be considered when designing such clients and servers.  This document attempts to outline these issues and to make recommendations in order to make the end products as interoperable as possible.
