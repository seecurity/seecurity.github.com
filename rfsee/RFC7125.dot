It improves the robustness of congestion control by preventing receivers from exploiting ECN to gain an unfair share of network bandwidth.  The ECN-nonce uses the two ECN-Capable Transport (ECT)codepoints in the ECN field of the IP header, and requires a flag in the TCP header.  It is computationally efficient for both routers and hosts.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];
