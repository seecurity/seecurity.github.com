Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation for Data
Frames in Control and Provisioning of
Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)
2018", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) is a protocol for encapsulating a station's data frames between the Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller (AC).  Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data frames can be either locally bridged or tunneled to the AC.  When tunneled, a CAPWAP Data Channel is used for tunneling.  In many deployments, encapsulating data frames to an entity other than the AC (for example, to an Access Router (AR)) is desirable.  Furthermore, it may also be desirable to use different tunnel encapsulation modes between the WTP and the Access Router.  This document defines an extension to the CAPWAP protocol that supports this capability and refers to it as alternate tunnel encapsulation.  The alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint different from the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many known encapsulation types, such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, or CAPWAP.  The WTP may advertise support for alternate tunnel encapsulation during the discovery and join process, and the AC may select one of the supported alternate tunnel encapsulation types while configuring the WTP."];

In the Split MAC mode description, IEEE 802.11 encryption is specified as located in either the Access Controller (AC) or the WTP, with no clear way for the AC to inform the WTP of where the encryption functionality should be located.  This leads to interoperability issues, especially when the AC and WTP come from different vendors.
