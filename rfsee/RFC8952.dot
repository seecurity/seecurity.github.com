Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):
Generic Syntax
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3986.html", target="_top", tooltip="A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.  The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Captive-Portal Identification in DHCP
and Router Advertisements (RAs)
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8910.html", target="_top", tooltip="In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a captive portal mode. This highly restricts what the user can do until the user has satisfied the captive portal conditions. This document describes a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 option and a Router Advertisement (RA) option to inform clients that they are behind some sort of captive portal enforcement device, and that they will need to satisfy the Captive Portal conditions to get Internet access. It is not a full solution to address all of the issues that clients may have with captive portals; it is designed to be one component of a standardized approach for hosts to interact with such portals. While this document defines how the network operator may convey the captive portal API endpoint to hosts, the specific methods of satisfying and interacting with the captive portal are out of scope of this document. This document replaces RFC 7710, which used DHCP code point 160. Due to a conflict, this document specifies 114. Consequently, this document also updates RFC 3679."];

Multiple Provisioning Domain
Architecture
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7556.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document is a product of the work of the Multiple Interfaces Architecture Design team.  It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues experienced by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks simultaneously.  The framework defines the concept of a Provisioning Domain (PvD), which is a consistent set of network configuration information.  PvD-aware nodes learn PvD-specific information from the networks they are attached to and/or other sources.  PvDs are used to enable separation and configuration consistency in the presence of multiple concurrent connections."];
