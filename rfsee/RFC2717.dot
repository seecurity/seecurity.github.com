The Mailbox Update (MUPDATE) Distributed

It is preferable to allow many machines to share the responsibility of mail delivery.  The Mailbox Update (MUPDATE) protocol allows a group of Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3) servers to function with a unified mailbox namespace.

This extension allows a client to subscribe to printing related Events. Subscriptions are modeled as Subscription Objects. The Subscription Object specifies that when one of the specified Events occurs, the Printer delivers an asynchronous Event Notification to the specified Notification Recipient via the specified Push or Pull Delivery Method (i.e., protocol). A client associates Subscription Objects with a particular Job by performing the Create-Job-Subscriptions operation or by submitting a Job with subscription information. A client associates Subscription Objects with the Printer by performing a Create-Printer-Subscriptions operation. Four other operations are defined for Subscription Objects: Get-Subscriptions-Attributes, Get-Subscriptions, Renew-Subscription, and Cancel-Subscription. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Scheme
for the Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP)
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4088.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Internet Standard Management Framework are widely used for the management of communication devices, creating a need to specify SNMP access (including access to SNMP MIB object instances) from non-SNMP management environments. For example, when out-of-band IP management is used via a separate management interface (e.g., for a device that does not support in-band IP access), a uniform way to indicate how to contact the device for management is needed. Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) fit this need well, as they allow a single text string to indicate a management access communication endpoint for a wide variety of IP-based protocols. This document defines a URI scheme so that SNMP can be designated as the protocol used for management. The scheme also allows a URI to designate one or more MIB object instances. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
