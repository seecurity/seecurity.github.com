Content Delivery Network Interconnection
(CDNI) Delegation Using the Automated
Certificate Management Environment
2024", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines metadata to support delegating the delivery of HTTPS content between two or more interconnected Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).  Specifically, this document defines a Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Metadata interface object to enable delegation of X.509 certificates leveraging delegation schemes defined in RFC 9115.  Per RFC 9115, delegating entities can remain in full control of the delegation and can revoke it at any time.  This avoids the need to share private cryptographic key material between the involved entities."];

An Automatic Certificate Management
Environment (ACME) Profile for
Generating Delegated Certificates
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9115.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a profile of the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol by which the holder of an identifier (e.g., a domain name) can allow a third party to obtain an X.509 certificate such that the certificate subject is the delegated identifier while the certified public key corresponds to a private key controlled by the third party.  A primary use case is that of a Content Delivery Network (CDN), the third party, terminating TLS sessions on behalf of a content provider (the holder of a domain name).  The presented mechanism allows the holder of the identifier to retain control over the delegation and revoke it at any time.  Importantly, this mechanism does not require any modification to the deployed TLS clients and servers."];

Framework for Content Distribution
Network Interconnection (CDNI)

The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the relationships among the various components necessary to interconnect CDNs.  CDNI requires the specification of interfaces and mechanisms to address issues such as request routing, distribution metadata exchange, and logging information exchange across CDNs.  The intent of this document is to outline what each interface needs to accomplish and to describe how these interfaces and mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed specification to other documents.  This document, in combination with RFC 6707, obsoletes RFC 3466."];

Support for Short-Term, Automatically

This memo proposes an Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) extension to enable the issuance of Short-Term, Automatically Renewed (STAR) X.509 certificates."];

SVCB records allow a service to be provided from multiple alternative endpoints, each with associated parameters (such as transport protocol configuration), and are extensible to support future uses (such as keys for encrypting the TLS ClientHello).  They also enable aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible with CNAME.  The HTTPS RR is a variation of SVCB for use with HTTP (see RFC 9110, HTTP Semantics).  By providing more information to the client before it attempts to establish a connection, these records offer potential benefits to both performance and privacy."];

Recommendations for Secure Use of

Over the years, the industry has witnessed several serious attacks on TLS and DTLS, including attacks on the most commonly used cipher suites and their modes of operation. This document provides the latest recommendations for ensuring the security of deployed services that use TLS and DTLS. These recommendations are applicable to the majority of use cases. RFC 7525, an earlier version of the TLS recommendations, was published when the industry was transitioning to TLS 1.2. Years later, this transition is largely complete, and TLS 1.3 is widely available. This document updates the guidance given the new environment and obsoletes RFC 7525. In addition, this document updates RFCs 5288 and 6066 in view of recent attacks."];
