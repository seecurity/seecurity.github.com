Home Network Prefix Renumbering in Proxy
Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)
2017", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification, a Mobile Node (MN) is assigned with a Home Network Prefix (HNP) during its initial attachment, and the MN configures its Home Address (HoA) with the HNP.  During the movement of the MN, the HNP remains unchanged to keep ongoing communications associated with the HoA.  However, the current PMIPv6 specification does not specify related operations when HNP renumbering has occurred (e.g., due to change of service provider or site topology, etc.).  In this document, a solution to support HNP renumbering is proposed, as an optional extension of the PMIPv6 specification."];

Mobility Support in IPv6
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6275.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Mobile IPv6, a protocol that allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.  This document obsoletes RFC 3775. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The handover problem space using the Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol is analyzed and the use of transient binding cache entries at the local mobility anchor is described.  The specified extension to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol ensures optimized forwarding of downlink as well as uplink packets between mobile nodes and the network infrastructure and avoids superfluous packet forwarding delay or even packet loss.
