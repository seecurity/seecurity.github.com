Happy Eyeballs: Success with Dual-Stack
Hosts
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6555.html", target="_top", tooltip="When a server's IPv4 path and protocol are working, but the server's IPv6 path and protocol are not working, a dual-stack client application experiences significant connection delay compared to an IPv4-only client.

This document specifies requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and provides an algorithm. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
