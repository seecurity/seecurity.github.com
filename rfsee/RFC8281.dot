It can compute optimal paths for traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic demands. PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP). SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS traffic-engineered (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing, Service Function Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network. It is, therefore, reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller. This document briefly introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller, examines the motivations and applicability for PCEP as a control protocol in this environment, and introduces the implications for the protocol.

Segment Routing
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9603.html", target="_top", tooltip="Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through a network using the IPv6 or MPLS data plane, employing the source routing paradigm. An SR Path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or a Path Computation Element (PCE). Since SR can be applied to both MPLS and IPv6 data planes, a PCE should be able to compute an SR Path for both MPLS and IPv6 data planes. The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) extension and mechanisms to support SR-MPLS have been defined. This document outlines the necessary extensions to support SR for the IPv6 data plane within PCEP."];

Carrying Binding Label/SID in PCE-Based
Networks
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9604.html", target="_top", tooltip="In order to provide greater scalability, network confidentiality, and service independence, Segment Routing (SR) utilizes a Binding Segment Identifier (BSID), as described in RFC 8402.  It is possible to associate a BSID to an RSVP-TE-signaled Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Path (LSP) or an SR TE path.  The BSID can be used by an upstream node for steering traffic into the appropriate TE path to enforce SR policies.  This document specifies the concept of binding value, which can be either an MPLS label or a Segment Identifier (SID).  It further specifies an extension to Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) for reporting the binding value by a Path Computation Client (PCC) to the Path Computation Element (PCE) to support PCE-based TE policies."];

Use Cases for a PCE as a Central
Controller (PCECC)
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9689.html", target="_top", tooltip="The PCE is a core component of a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) system. It can be used to compute optimal paths for network traffic and update existing paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic demands. The PCE was developed to derive Traffic Engineering (TE) paths in MPLS networks, which are supplied to the headend of the paths using the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP). SDN has much broader applicability than signalled MPLS TE networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range of use cases including static Label-Switched Paths (LSPs), Segment Routing (SR), Service Function Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller. A PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN without necessarily completely replacing it. This document describes general considerations for PCECC deployment and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges and limitations, through a number of use cases. PCEP extensions, which are required for the PCECC use cases, are covered in separate documents."];

Interworking of GMPLS Control and
Centralized Controller Systems
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9730.html", target="_top", tooltip="Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows each network element (NE) to perform local resource discovery, routing, and signaling in a distributed manner. The advancement of software-defined transport networking technology enables a group of NEs to be managed through centralized controller hierarchies. This helps to tackle challenges arising from multiple domains, vendors, and technologies. An example of such a centralized architecture is the Abstraction and Control of Traffic-Engineered Networks (ACTN) controller hierarchy, as described in RFC 8453. Both the distributed and centralized control planes have their respective advantages and should complement each other in the system, rather than compete. This document outlines how the GMPLS distributed control plane can work together with a centralized controller system in a transport network."];
