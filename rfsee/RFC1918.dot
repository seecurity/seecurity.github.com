The Address plus Port (A+P) Approach to
the IPv4 Address Shortage
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6346.html", target="_top", tooltip="We are facing the exhaustion of the IANA IPv4 free IP address pool. Unfortunately, IPv6 is not yet deployed widely enough to fully replace IPv4, and it is unrealistic to expect that this is going to change before the depletion of IPv4 addresses. Letting hosts seamlessly communicate in an IPv4 world without assigning a unique globally routable IPv4 address to each of them is a challenging problem. This document proposes an IPv4 address sharing scheme, treating some of the port number bits as part of an extended IPv4 address (Address plus Port, or A+P). Instead of assigning a single IPv4 address to a single customer device, we propose to extend the address field by using bits from the port number range in the TCP/UDP header as additional endpoint identifiers, thus leaving a reduced range of ports available to applications. This means assigning the same IPv4 address to multiple clients (e.g., Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), mobile phones), each with its assigned port range. In the face of IPv4 address exhaustion, the need for addresses is stronger than the need to be able to address thousands of applications on a single host. If address translation is needed, the end-user should be in control of the translation process -- not some smart boxes in the core.

FTP has an active and a passive mode, both as original commands that are IPv4-specific and as extended, IP version agnostic commands. The only FTP mode that works without changes through an IPv6-to-IPv4 translator is extended passive. However, many existing FTP servers do not support this mode, and some clients do not ask for it.

AS112 Nameserver Operations

Examples are the addresses designated in RFC 1918 for private use within individual sites. Devices in such environments may occasionally originate Domain Name System (DNS) queries (so-called reverse lookups) corresponding to those private-use addresses. Since the addresses concerned have only local significance, it is good practice for site administrators to ensure that such queries are answered locally. However, it is not uncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation path in the public DNS instead of being answered within the site. It is not possible for public DNS servers to give useful answers to such queries. In addition, due to the wide deployment of private-use addresses and the continuing growth of the Internet, the volume of such queries is large and growing. The AS112 project aims to provide a distributed sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on the corresponding authoritative servers.

An Autonomic Control Plane (ACP)

This Autonomic Control Plane should ideally be self-managing and be as independent as possible of configuration.  This document defines such a plane and calls it the Autonomic Control Plane, with the primary use as a control plane for autonomic functions.  It also serves as a virtual out-of-band channel for Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) communications over a network that provides automatically configured, hop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via automatically configured IPv6 even when the network is not configured or is misconfigured."];

Operational Security Considerations for

RFC 4942 describes security issues in the protocol, but network managers also need a more practical, operations-minded document to enumerate advantages and/or disadvantages of certain choices. This document analyzes the operational security issues associated with several types of networks and proposes technical and procedural mitigation techniques. This document is only applicable to managed networks, such as enterprise networks, service provider networks, or managed residential networks."];

The Use of maxLength in the Resource

One recommendation is to avoid using the maxLength attribute in ROAs except in some specific cases.  The recommendations complement and extend those in RFC 7115.  This document also discusses the creation of ROAs for facilitating the use of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation services.

An Encrypted DNS Resolver discovered in this manner is referred to as a Designated Resolver.  These mechanisms can be used to move from unencrypted DNS to encrypted DNS when only the IP address of a resolver is known.  These mechanisms are designed to be limited to cases where Unencrypted DNS Resolvers and their Designated Resolvers are operated by the same entity or cooperating entities.  It can also be used to discover support for encrypted DNS protocols when the name of an Encrypted DNS Resolver is known."];

Simple Provisioning of Public Names for

Home networks are increasingly numbered using IPv6 addresses, which in principle makes this access simpler, but accessing home networks from the Internet requires the names and IP addresses of these devices and services to be made available in the public DNS. This document describes how a Home Naming Authority (NHA) instructs the outsourced infrastructure to publish these pieces of information in the public DNS. The names and IP addresses of the home network are set in the Public Homenet Zone by the Homenet Naming Authority (HNA), which in turn instructs an outsourced infrastructure to publish the zone on behalf of the home network owner."];

Distribution of Link-State and Traffic
Engineering Information Using BGP
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9552.html", target="_top", tooltip="In many environments, a component external to a network is called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and the current state of the connections within the network, including Traffic Engineering (TE) information. This is information typically distributed by IGP routing protocols within the network. This document describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE information can be collected from networks and shared with external components using the BGP routing protocol. This is achieved using a BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding format. The mechanism applies to physical and virtual (e.g., tunnel) IGP links. The mechanism described is subject to policy control. Applications of this technique include Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) servers and Path Computation Elements (PCEs). This document obsoletes RFC 7752 by completely replacing that document. It makes some small changes and clarifications to the previous specification.

However, none of them discuss how to apply pseudorandom port numbers from RFC 4814 to any stateful NATxy (such as NAT44, NAT64, and NAT66) technologies.  This document discusses why using pseudorandom port numbers with stateful NATxy gateways is a difficult problem.  It recommends a solution that limits the port number ranges and uses two test phases (phase 1 and phase 2).  This document shows how the classic performance measurement procedures (e.g., throughput, frame loss rate, latency, etc.) can be carried out.  New performance metrics and measurement procedures are also defined for measuring the maximum connection establishment rate, connection tear-down rate, and connection tracking table capacity."];
