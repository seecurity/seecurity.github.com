Architectural Considerations on
Application Features in the DNS
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6950.html", target="_top", tooltip="A number of Internet applications rely on the Domain Name System (DNS) to support their operations.  Many applications use the DNS to locate services for a domain; some, for example, transform identifiers other than domain names into formats that the DNS can process, and then fetch application data or service location data from the DNS.  Proposals incorporating sophisticated application behavior using DNS as a substrate have raised questions about the role of the DNS as an application platform.  This document explores the architectural consequences of using the DNS to implement certain application features, and it provides guidance to future application designers as to the limitations of the DNS as a substrate and the situations in which alternative designs should be considered."];
