Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base

RBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are as invisible to current IP routers as bridges are and, like routers, they terminate the bridge spanning tree protocol. The design supports VLANs and the optimization of the distribution of multi-destination frames based on VLAN ID and based on IP-derived multicast groups. It also allows unicast forwarding tables at transit RBridges to be sized according to the number of RBridges (rather than the number of end nodes), which allows their forwarding tables to be substantially smaller than in conventional customer bridges.

Using Router Advertisements to Signal
the Availability of DHCPv6 Prefix
Delegation to Clients
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9762.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the P flag in the Prefix Information Option (PIO) of IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs). The flag is used to indicate that the network prefers that clients use the deployment model in RFC 9663 instead of using individual addresses in the on-link prefix assigned using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) or DHCPv6 address assignment. This document updates RFC 4862 to indicate that the Autonomous flag in a PIO needs to be ignored if the PIO has the P flag set. It also updates RFC 4861 to specify that the P flag indicates DHCPv6 prefix delegation support for clients."];

EVPN Port-Active Redundancy Mode

The objective of MC-LAG is to enhance both network availability and bandwidth utilization through various modes of traffic load balancing.  RFC 7432 defines an EVPN-based MC-LAG with Single-Active and All-Active multihoming redundancy modes.  This document builds on the existing redundancy mechanisms supported by EVPN and introduces a new active/standby redundancy mode, called 'Port-Active'."];

model, which is designed to be reusable by other models.  This design
is meant to ensure consistent AC structures among models that
manipulate ACs.  For example, this common model can be reused by
service models to expose ACs as a service, service models that
require binding a service to a set of ACs, network and device models
to provision ACs, etc."];
