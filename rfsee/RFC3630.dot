We call such a zone of visibility of TE information a domain. An example of a domain may be an IGP area or an Autonomous System. In order to determine the potential to establish a TE path through a series of connected networks, it is necessary to have available a certain amount of TE information about each network.

IGP Flexible Algorithms: Bandwidth,
Delay, Metrics, and Constraints
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9843.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many networks configure the IGP link metric relative to the link capacity, and high bandwidth traffic gets routed per the link capacity. Flexible Algorithms provide mechanisms to create constraint-based paths in an IGP. This specification documents a generic metric-type and a set of bandwidth-related constraints to be used in Flexible Algorithms. This document updates RFC 9350."];

Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
Extension for Color

For example, a TE Tunnel constructed to deliver low latency services and whose path is optimized for delay can be tagged with a color that represents low latency. This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) to carry the color attribute."];
