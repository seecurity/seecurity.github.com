Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping in Split
Scenario
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="A Mobile IPv6 node requires a Home Agent address, a home address, and IPsec security associations with its Home Agent before it can start utilizing Mobile IPv6 service.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these are statically configured.  This document defines how a Mobile IPv6 node can bootstrap this information from non-topological information and security credentials pre-configured on the Mobile Node.  The solution defined in this document solves the split scenario described in the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem statement in RFC 4640.  The split scenario refers to the case where the Mobile Node's mobility service is authorized by a different service provider than basic network access.  The solution described in this document is also generically applicable to any bootstrapping case, since other scenarios are more specific realizations of the split scenario.

Why the Authentication Data Suboption is

These authentication signaling messages between the mobile node and home agent are secured by an IPsec security association (SA) that is established between the MN and HA.  The MIP6 working group has specified a mechanism to secure the Binding Update (BU) and Binding Acknowledgement (BAck) messages using an authentication option, similar to the authentication option in Mobile IPv4, carried within the signaling messages that are exchanged between the MN and HA to establish a binding.  This document provides the justifications as to why the authentication option mechanism is needed for Mobile IPv6 deployment in certain environments.

It includes a brief description of each RFC, along with background information explaining the motivation and context of IPsec's outgrowths and extensions. It obsoletes RFC 2411, the previous IP Security Document Roadmap. The obsoleted IPsec roadmap (RFC 2411) briefly described the interrelationship of the various classes of base IPsec documents.

Scoped Interpretation of DNS Resource
Records through Underscored Naming of

2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8552.html", target="_top", tooltip="Formally, any DNS Resource Record (RR) may occur under any domain name.  However, some services use an operational convention for defining specific interpretations of an RRset by locating the records in a DNS branch under the parent domain to which the RRset actually applies.  The top of this subordinate branch is defined by a naming convention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with the underscore character (e.g., _name).  The underscored naming construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent domain above the underscored branch.  This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names registry with IANA.  The purpose of this registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the use of the same underscored name for different services."];
