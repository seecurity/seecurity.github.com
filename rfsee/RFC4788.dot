Enhancements to RTP Payload Formats for

In particular, it defines support for the header-free and interleaved/bundled packet formats for the EVRC-B codec, a new compact bundled format for the EVRC and EVRC-B codecs, as well as discontinuous transmission (DTX) support for EVRC and EVRC-B-encoded speech transported via RTP.  Voice over IP (VoIP) applications operating over low bandwidth dial-up and wireless networks require such enhancements for efficient use of the bandwidth.
