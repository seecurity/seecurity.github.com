Examples of where roaming capabilities might be required include ISP confederations and \%ISP-provided corporate network access support.

In many remote access scenarios, a mechanism for making the remote host appear to be present on the local corporate network is quite useful.  This may be accomplished by assigning the host a virtual address from the corporate network, and then tunneling traffic via IPsec from the host's ISP-assigned address to the corporate security gateway.  In IPv4, DHCP provides for such remote host configuration. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.

It includes a brief description of each RFC, along with background information explaining the motivation and context of IPsec's outgrowths and extensions.
