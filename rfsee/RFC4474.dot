For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication.  ZRTP can utilize a Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication through the signaling channel.
