Protocol (SDP) and Real-time Transport
Protocol (RTP) for Media Loopback
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6849.html", target="_top", tooltip="The wide deployment of Voice over IP (VoIP), real-time text, and Video over IP services has introduced new challenges in managing and maintaining real-time voice/text/video quality, reliability, and overall performance.  In particular, media delivery is an area that needs attention.  One method of meeting these challenges is monitoring the media delivery performance by looping media back to the transmitter.  This is typically referred to as active monitoring of services.  Media loopback is especially popular in ensuring the quality of transport to the edge of a given VoIP, real-time text, or Video over IP service.  Today, in networks that deliver real-time media, short of running 'ping' and 'traceroute' to the edge, administrators are left without the necessary tools to actively monitor, manage, and diagnose quality issues with their service.  The extension defined herein adds new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media types and attributes that enable establishment of media sessions where the media is looped back to the transmitter.  Such media sessions will serve as monitoring and troubleshooting tools by providing the means for measurement of more advanced VoIP, real-time text, and Video over IP performance metrics."];

Security Threats and Requirements for
Emergency Call Marking and Mapping

Based on the identified threats, this document establishes a set of security requirements for the mapping protocol and for the handling of emergency-marked calls.

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA. This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];

Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)
Callback
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7090.html", target="_top", tooltip="After an emergency call is completed (terminated either prematurely by the emergency caller or normally by the call taker), the call taker may feel the need for further communication. For example, the call may have been dropped by accident without the call taker having sufficient information about the current state of an accident victim. A call taker may trigger a callback to the emergency caller using the contact information provided with the initial emergency call. This callback could, under certain circumstances, be treated like any other call and, as a consequence, it may get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an answering machine. The IETF emergency services architecture specification already offers a solution approach for allowing Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) callbacks to bypass authorization policies in order to reach the caller without unnecessary delays. Unfortunately, the specified mechanism only supports limited scenarios. This document discusses shortcomings of the current mechanisms and illustrates additional scenarios where better-than-normal call treatment behavior would be desirable. We describe a solution based on a new header field value for the SIP Priority header field, called psap-callback, to mark PSAP callbacks."];

This document describes data structures and mechanisms to convey such data to the PSAP. The intent is that every emergency call carry as much of the information described here as possible using the mechanisms described here. The mechanisms permit the data to be conveyed by reference (as an external resource) or by value (within the body of a SIP message or a location object). This follows the tradition of prior emergency services standardization work where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling (i.e., in the body of the SIP message) or by reference."];

Such calls are often referred to as Automatic Crash Notification (ACN), or Advanced Automatic Crash Notification (AACN), even in the case of manual trigger. The Advanced qualifier refers to the ability to carry a richer set of data. This document also registers a MIME media type and Emergency Call Data Type for the vehicle, sensor, and location data (often referred to as crash data even though there is not necessarily a crash) and an INFO package to enable carrying this and related data in SIP INFO requests. An external specification for the data format, contents, and structure is referenced in this document. This document reuses the technical aspects of next-generation Pan- European eCall (a mandated and standardized system for emergency calls by in-vehicle systems (IVSs) within Europe and other regions). However, this document specifies use of a different set of vehicle (crash) data, specifically, the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) rather than the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD). This document is an extension of the IETF eCall document, with the primary differences being that this document makes the MSD data set optional and VEDS mandatory, and it adds attribute values to the metadata/control object to permit greater functionality. This document registers a new INFO package (identical to that registered for eCall but with the addition of the VEDS MIME type). This document also describes legacy (circuit-switched) ACN systems and their migration to next-generation emergency calling, to provide background information and context."];

This is especially important for emergency calls, because it allows for a call to be handled by a call taker capable of communicating with the user or for a translator or relay operator to be bridged into the call during setup. However, this also applies to non-emergency calls (for example, calls to a company call center). This document describes the need as well as a solution that uses new SDP media attributes."];

The CA interprets using sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.  Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency, termed a provider in this document.  The provider also provides a video service that allows users to connect video devices to their service and subsequently to CAs and other sign language speakers.
