In a similar manner, network virtualization is encouraging migration of networking functions from dedicated physical hardware nodes to a virtualized pool of resources.  However, network virtualization can be considered to be a more complex problem than cloud computing as it not only involves virtualization of computing and storage functions but also involves abstraction of the network itself.

This procedure may be complex and take time. In order to simplify rechaining and reduce the time to complete the procedure, we discuss separating the logical Service Function Path (SFP) from the specific execution endpoints.

With the L4S architecture, all Internet applications could (but do not have to) transition away from congestion control algorithms that cause substantial queuing delay and instead adopt a new class of congestion controls that can seek capacity with very little queuing. These are aided by a modified form of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) from the network. With this new architecture, applications can have both low latency and high throughput. The architecture primarily concerns incremental deployment.

A PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN without necessarily completely replacing it. This document describes general considerations for PCECC deployment and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges and limitations, through a number of use cases. PCEP extensions, which are required for the PCECC use cases, are covered in separate documents."];

A Framework for NRP-Based Enhanced
Virtual Private Networks
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9732.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a framework for Enhanced Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) based on Network Resource Partitions (NRPs) in order to support the needs of applications with specific traffic performance requirements (e.g., low latency, bounded jitter).  NRP-based enhanced VPNs leverage the VPN and Traffic Engineering (TE) technologies and add characteristics that specific services require beyond those provided by conventional VPNs.  Typically, an NRP-based enhanced VPN will be used to underpin network slicing, but it could also be of use in its own right providing enhanced connectivity services between customer sites.  This document also provides an overview of relevant technologies in different network layers and identifies some areas for potential new work."];

A Common YANG Data Model for Attachment
Circuits
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9833.html", target="_top", tooltip="The document specifies a common attachment circuits (ACs) YANG data
model, which is designed to be reusable by other models.  This design
is meant to ensure consistent AC structures among models that
manipulate ACs.  For example, this common model can be reused by
service models to expose ACs as a service, service models that
require binding a service to a set of ACs, network and device models
to provision ACs, etc."];

YANG Data Models for Bearers and
Attachment Circuits as a Service (ACaaS)
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9834.html", target="_top", tooltip="Delivery of network services assumes that appropriate setup is
provisioned over the links that connect customer termination points
and a provider network. The required setup to allow successful data
exchange over these links is referred to as an attachment circuit
(AC), while the underlying link is referred to as a bearer. This document specifies a YANG service data model for ACs. This model
can be used for the provisioning of ACs before or during service
provisioning (e.g., RFC 9543 Network Slice Service). The document also specifies a YANG service data model for managing
bearers over which ACs are established."];

A YANG Data Model for Augmenting VPN
Service and Network Models with
Attachment Circuits
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9836.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a YANG data model, referred to as the AC Glue
model, to augment the LxVPN Service Model (LxSM) and LxVPN Network
Model (LxNM) with references to attachment circuits (ACs).  The AC
Glue model enables a provider to associate Layer 2/3 VPN (LxVPN)
services with the underlying AC infrastructure, thereby facilitating
consistent provisioning and management of new or existing ACs in
conjunction with LxVPN services.  Specifically, by introducing an
integrated approach to AC and LxVPN management, this model supports
Attachment Circuit as a Service (ACaaS) and provides a standardized
mechanism for aligning AC/VPN requests with the network
configurations required to deliver them."];
