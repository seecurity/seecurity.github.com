TCP Performance Implications of Network
Path Asymmetry
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3449.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes TCP performance problems that arise because of asymmetric effects.  These problems arise in several access networks, including bandwidth-asymmetric networks and packet radio subnetworks, for different underlying reasons.  However, the end result on TCP performance is the same in both cases: performance often degrades significantly because of imperfection and variability in the ACK feedback from the receiver to the sender.  The document details several mitigations to these effects, which have either been proposed or evaluated in the literature, or are currently deployed in networks.  These solutions use a combination of local link- layer techniques, subnetwork, and end-to-end mechanisms, consisting of: (i) techniques to manage the channel used for the upstream bottleneck link carrying the ACKs, typically using header compression or reducing the frequency of TCP ACKs, (ii) techniques to handle this reduced ACK frequency to retain the TCP sender's acknowledgment-triggered self- clocking and (iii) techniques to schedule the data and ACK packets in the reverse direction to improve performance in the presence of two-way traffic.  Each technique is described, together with known issues, and recommendations for use.  A summary of the recommendations is provided at the end of the document.

Protocol Extensions for Header
Compression over MPLS
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4901.html", target="_top", tooltip="This specification defines how to use Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) to route Header-Compressed (HC) packets over an MPLS label switched path.  HC can significantly reduce packet-header overhead and, in combination with MPLS, can also increases bandwidth efficiency and processing scalability in terms of the maximum number of simultaneous compressed flows that use HC at each router).  Here we define how MPLS pseudowires are used to transport the HC context and control messages between the ingress and egress MPLS label switching routers.  This is defined for a specific set of existing HC mechanisms that might be used, for example, to support voice over IP.  This specification also describes extension mechanisms to allow support for future, as yet to be defined, HC protocols.  In this specification, each HC protocol operates independently over a single pseudowire instance, very much as it would over a single point-to-point link. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
