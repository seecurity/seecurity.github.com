Problem Statement and Requirements for
Transporting User-to-User Call Control
Information in SIP
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document introduces the transport of call control User-to-User Information (UUI) using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and develops several requirements for a new SIP mechanism.  Some SIP sessions are established by or related to a non-SIP application.  This application may have information that needs to be transported between the SIP User Agents during session establishment.  In addition to interworking with the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) UUI Service, this extension will also be used for native SIP endpoints requiring application UUI.

A Mechanism for Transporting User-to-
User Call Control Information in SIP
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7433.html", target="_top", tooltip="There is a class of applications that benefit from using SIP to exchange User-to-User Information (UUI) data during session establishment.  This information, known as call control UUI data, is a small piece of data inserted by an application initiating the session and utilized by an application accepting the session.  The syntax and semantics for the UUI data used by a specific application are defined by a UUI package.  This UUI data is opaque to SIP and its function is unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document defines a new SIP header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI data, along with an extension mechanism."];

Interworking ISDN Call Control User

As networks move to SIP, it is important that applications requiring this data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as have the ability to interwork with this ISDN service for end-to-end transparency. This document defines a usage (a new package called the ISDN UUI package) of the User-to-User header field to enable interworking with this ISDN service. This document covers interworking with both public ISDN and private ISDN capabilities, so the potential interworking with QSIG will also be addressed. The package is identified by the new value isdn-uui of the purpose header field parameter."];
