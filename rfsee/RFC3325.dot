SIP-Based Messaging with S/MIME

While these provide mechanisms for hop-by-hop security, neither natively provides end-to-end protection.  This document offers guidance on how to provide end-to-end authentication, integrity protection, and confidentiality using the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME).  It updates and provides clarifications for RFCs 3261, 3428, and 4975."];

Location Source Parameter for the SIP
Geolocation Header Field

Knowing the identity of the node adding the locationValue allows the recipient more freedom in selecting the value to look at first rather than relying solely on the order of the locationValues.  This document defines the loc-src parameter so that the entity adding the locationValue to the Geolocation header field can identify itself using its hostname.  This document updates RFC 6442."];

Non-interactive Emergency Calls
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8876.html", target="_top", tooltip="Use of the Internet for emergency calling is described in RFC 6443, 'Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia'.  In some cases of emergency calls, the transmission of application data is all that is needed, and no interactive media channel is established: a situation referred to as 'non-interactive emergency calls', where, unlike most emergency calls, there is no two-way interactive media such as voice or video or text.  This document describes use of a SIP MESSAGE transaction that includes a container for the data based on the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).  That type of emergency request does not establish a session, distinguishing it from SIP INVITE, which does.  Any device that needs to initiate a request for emergency services without an interactive media channel would use the mechanisms in this document."];

Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT)
Extension for Rich Call Data

This framework is intended to include and extend caller- and call-specific information beyond human-readable display name, comparable to the Caller ID function common on the telephone network.  It is also enhanced with an integrity mechanism that is designed to protect the authoring and transport of this information for different authoritative use cases."];

SIP Call-Info Parameters for Rich Call
Data

RCD includes information about the caller beyond the telephone number (such as a calling name, logo, photo, or jCard object representing the caller), which can help the called party decide how to handle the session request. This document defines three new parameters 'call-reason', 'verified', and 'integrity' for the SIP Call-Info header field and also a new token (jcard) for the 'purpose' parameter of the Call-Info header field. It also provides guidance on the use of the Call-Info 'purpose' parameter token, icon."];
