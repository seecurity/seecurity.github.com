This document describes a series of use cases in order to showcase the architectural capabilities.  It further shows how the RANGER architecture restores the network-within-network principles originally intended for the sustained growth of the Internet.

IRON further addresses other important issues including routing scaling, mobility management, multihoming, traffic engineering and NAT traversal.
