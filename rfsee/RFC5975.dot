Guidelines for Writing an IANA

Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec).

For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made.

Service provider (SP) IP/MPLS networks need an MPLS GCAC mechanism, as one motivational example, to reject Voice over IP (VoIP) calls when additional calls would adversely affect calls already in progress.  Without MPLS GCAC, connections on congested links will suffer degraded quality.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm can be optionally implemented in vendor equipment and deployed by service providers.  MPLS GCAC interoperates between vendor equipment and across multiple service provider domains.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm uses available standard mechanisms for MPLS-based networks, such as RSVP, Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE), Path Computation Element (PCE), Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS), Diffserv, and OSPF.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm does not include aspects of CAC that might be considered vendor proprietary implementations, such as detailed path selection mechanisms.  MPLS GCAC functions are implemented in a distributed manner to deliver the objective Quality of Service (QoS) for specified QoS constraints.  The objective is that the source is able to compute a source route with high likelihood that via-elements along the selected path will in fact admit the request.  In some cases (e.g., multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes)), this objective cannot always be met, but this document summarizes methods that partially meet this objective.
