The Architecture of Direct Data
Placement (DDP) and Remote Direct Memory
Access (RDMA) on Internet Protocols
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines an abstract architecture for Direct Data Placement (DDP) and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) protocols to run on Internet Protocol-suite transports.  This architecture does not necessarily reflect the proper way to implement such protocols, but is, rather, a descriptive tool for defining and understanding the protocols.  DDP allows the efficient placement of data into buffers designated by Upper Layer Protocols (e.g., RDMA).  RDMA provides the semantics to enable Remote Direct Memory Access between peers in a way consistent with application requirements.

Marker PDU Aligned Framing for TCP
Specification
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5044.html", target="_top", tooltip="Marker PDU Aligned Framing (MPA) is designed to work as an adaptation layer between TCP and the Direct Data Placement protocol (DDP) as described in RFC 5041.  It preserves the reliable, in-order delivery of TCP, while adding the preservation of higher-level protocol record boundaries that DDP requires.  MPA is fully compliant with applicable TCP RFCs and can be utilized with existing TCP implementations.  MPA also supports integrated implementations that combine TCP, MPA and DDP to reduce buffering requirements in the implementation and improve performance at the system level. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
