Revised Error Handling for BGP UPDATE
Messages

This document partially revises the error handling for UPDATE messages and provides guidelines for the authors of documents defining new attributes. Finally, it revises the error handling procedures for a number of existing attributes. This document updates error handling for RFCs 1997, 4271, 4360, 4456, 4760, 5543, 5701, and 6368."];

Explicit Tracking with Wildcard Routes
in Multicast VPN
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8534.html", target="_top", tooltip="The base Multicast VPN (MVPN) specifications (RFCs 6513 and 6514) provide procedures to allow a multicast ingress node to invoke explicit tracking for a multicast flow or set of flows, thus learning the egress nodes for that flow or set of flows.  However, the specifications are not completely clear about how the explicit tracking procedures work in certain scenarios.  This document provides the necessary clarifications.  It also specifies a new, optimized explicit-tracking procedure.  This new procedure allows an ingress node, by sending a single message, to request explicit tracking of each of a set of flows, where the set of flows is specified using a wildcard mechanism.

MVPN/EVPN Tunnel Aggregation with Common
Labels
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9573.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Multicast VPN (MVPN) specifications allow a single Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) tunnel to carry traffic of multiple IP VPNs (referred to as VPNs in this document).  The EVPN specifications allow a single P2MP tunnel to carry traffic of multiple Broadcast Domains (BDs).  These features require the ingress router of the P2MP tunnel to allocate an upstream-assigned MPLS label for each VPN or for each BD.  A packet sent on a P2MP tunnel then carries the label that is mapped to its VPN or BD (in some cases, a distinct upstream-assigned label is needed for each flow.) Since each ingress router allocates labels independently, with no coordination among the ingress routers, the egress routers may need to keep track of a large number of labels.  The number of labels may need to be as large as, or larger than, the product of the number of ingress routers times the number of VPNs or BDs.  However, the number of labels can be greatly reduced if the association between a label and a VPN or BD is made by provisioning, so that all ingress routers assign the same label to a particular VPN or BD.  New procedures are needed in order to take advantage of such provisioned labels.  These new procedures also apply to Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) tunnels.  This document updates RFCs 6514, 7432, and 7582 by specifying the necessary procedures."];

Optimized Ingress Replication Solution
for Ethernet VPNs (EVPNs)
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9574.html", target="_top", tooltip="Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) networks using Ethernet VPNs (EVPNs) as their control plane may use trees based on ingress replication or Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) to convey the overlay Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, or Multicast (BUM) traffic.  PIM provides an efficient solution that prevents sending multiple copies of the same packet over the same physical link; however, it may not always be deployed in the NVO network core.  Ingress replication avoids the dependency on PIM in the NVO network core.  While ingress replication provides a simple multicast transport, some NVO networks with demanding multicast applications require a more efficient solution without PIM in the core.  This document describes a solution to optimize the efficiency of ingress replication trees."];
