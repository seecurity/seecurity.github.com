Device Reset Characterization

This document specifies a methodology for characterizing reset (and reset time) during benchmarking of forwarding devices and provides clarity and consistency in reset test procedures beyond what is specified in RFC 2544. Therefore, it updates RFC 2544. This document also defines the benchmarking term reset time and, only in this, updates RFC 1242.

Applicability Statement for RFC 2544:
Use on Production Networks Considered
Harmful

The methods described in RFC 2544 are intended to generate traffic that overloads network device resources in order to assess their capacity.  Overload of shared resources would likely be harmful to user traffic performance on a production network, and there are further negative consequences identified with production application of the methods.  This memo clarifies the scope of RFC 2544 and other IETF BMWG benchmarking work for isolated test environments only, and it encourages new standards activity for measurement methods applicable outside that scope.

IMIX Genome: Specification of Variable
Packet Sizes for Additional Testing
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6985.html", target="_top", tooltip="Benchmarking methodologies have always relied on test conditions with constant packet sizes, with the goal of understanding what network device capability has been tested.  Tests with a constant packet size reveal device capabilities but differ significantly from the conditions encountered in operational deployment, so additional tests are sometimes conducted with a mixture of packet sizes, or IMIX (Internet Mix).  The mixture of sizes a networking device will encounter is highly variable and depends on many factors.  An IMIX suited for one networking device and deployment will not be appropriate for another.  However, the mix of sizes may be known, and the tester may be asked to augment the fixed-size tests.  To address this need and the perpetual goal of specifying repeatable test conditions, this document defines a way to specify the exact repeating sequence of packet sizes from the usual set of fixed sizes and from other forms of mixed-size specification."];
