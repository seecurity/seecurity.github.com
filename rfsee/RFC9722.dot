Fast Recovery for EVPN Designated
Forwarder Election
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution in RFC 7432 provides Designated Forwarder (DF) election procedures for multihomed Ethernet Segments. These procedures have been enhanced further by applying the Highest Random Weight (HRW) algorithm for DF election to avoid unnecessary DF status changes upon a failure. This document improves these procedures by providing a fast DF election upon recovery of the failed link or node associated with the multihomed Ethernet Segment. This document updates RFC 8584 by optionally introducing delays between some of the events therein. The solution is independent of the number of EVPN Instances (EVIs) associated with that Ethernet Segment, and it is performed via a simple signaling in BGP between the recovered node and each of the other nodes in the multihoming group."];

NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family.  NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs.  It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not required.  It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism."];

This specification is also applicable to Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (GENEVE); however, some incremental work is required, which will be covered in a separate document.
