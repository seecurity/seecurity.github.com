Label Edge Router Forwarding of IPv4
Option Packets
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies how Label Edge Routers (LERs) should behave when determining whether to MPLS encapsulate an IPv4 packet with header options.  Lack of a formal standard has resulted in different LER forwarding behaviors for IPv4 packets with header options despite being associated with a prefix-based Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC).  IPv4 option packets that belong to a prefix-based FEC, yet are forwarded into an IPv4/MPLS network without being MPLS- encapsulated, present a security risk against the MPLS infrastructure.  Further, LERs that are unable to MPLS encapsulate IPv4 packets with header options cannot operate in certain MPLS environments.  While this newly defined LER behavior is mandatory to implement, it is optional to invoke. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Label Stack Entry: EXP Field Renamed to
Traffic Class Field

This includes a three-bit field called the EXP field. The exact use of this field was not defined by these documents, except to state that it was to be reserved for experimental use. Although the intended use of the EXP field was as a Class of Service (CoS) field, it was not named a CoS field by these early documents because the use of such a CoS field was not considered to be sufficiently defined. Today a number of standards documents define its usage as a CoS field. To avoid misunderstanding about how this field may be used, it has become increasingly necessary to rename this field. This document changes the name of the field to the Traffic Class field (TC field). In doing so, it also updates documents that define the current use of the EXP field. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

IP Router Alert Considerations and Usage

This document discusses security aspects and usage guidelines around the use of the current IP Router Alert Option, thereby updating RFC 2113 and RFC 2711.
