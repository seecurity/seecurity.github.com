Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD)
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="To enable seamless IP-layer handover of a mobile node (MN) from one access router (AR) to another, the MN is required to discover the identities and capabilities of candidate ARs (CARs) for handover prior to the initiation of the handover.  The act of discovery of CARs has two aspects: identifying the IP addresses of the CARs and finding their capabilities.  This process is called candidate access router discovery (CARD).  At the time of IP-layer handover, the CAR, whose capabilities are a good match to the preferences of the MN, is chosen as the target AR for handover.  The protocol described in this document allows a mobile node to perform CARD.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Instructions for Seamoby and
Experimental Mobility Protocol IANA
Allocations
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4065.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol and the Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) are experimental protocols designed to accelerate IP handover between wireless access routers.  These protocols require IANA allocations for ICMP type and options, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Payload Protocol Identifiers, port numbers, and registries for certain formatted message options.  This document contains instructions to IANA about which allocations are required for the Seamoby protocols.  The ICMP subtype extension format for Seamoby has been additionally designed so that it can be utilized by other experimental mobility protocols, and the SCTP port number is also available for other experimental mobility protocols.

This document defines the network discovery and selection problem, dividing it into multiple sub- problems.  Some constraints on potential solutions are outlined, and the limitations of several solutions (including existing ones) are discussed.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

A Framework of Media-Independent Pre-
Authentication (MPA) for Inter-Domain
Handover Optimization
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6252.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes Media-independent Pre-Authentication (MPA), a new handover optimization mechanism that addresses the issues on existing mobility management protocols and mobility optimization mechanisms to support inter-domain handover. MPA is a mobile- assisted, secure handover optimization scheme that works over any link layer and with any mobility management protocol, and is most applicable to supporting optimization during inter-domain handover. MPA's pre-authentication, pre-configuration, and proactive handover techniques allow many of the handoff-related operations to take place before the mobile node has moved to the new network. We describe the details of all the associated techniques and their applicability for different scenarios involving various mobility protocols during inter-domain handover. We have implemented the MPA mechanism for various network-layer and application-layer mobility protocols, and we report a summary of experimental performance results in this document. This document is a product of the IP Mobility Optimizations (MOBOPTS) Research Group. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
