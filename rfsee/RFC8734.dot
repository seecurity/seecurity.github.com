Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
Brainpool Curves for Transport Layer
Security (TLS) Version 1.3

However, these curves have not been shown to have significant cryptographical weaknesses, and there is some interest in using several of these curves in TLS 1.3. This document provides the necessary protocol mechanisms for using ECC Brainpool curves in TLS 1.3. This approach is not endorsed by the IETF.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
