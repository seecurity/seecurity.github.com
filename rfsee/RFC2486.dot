Examples of where roaming capabilities might be required include ISP confederations and \%ISP-provided corporate network access support.

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In
User Service) Support For Extensible
Authentication Protocol (EAP)
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3579.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) support for the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), an authentication framework which supports multiple authentication mechanisms.  In the proposed scheme, the Network Access Server (NAS) forwards EAP packets to and from the RADIUS server, encapsulated within EAP-Message attributes.  This has the advantage of allowing the NAS to support any EAP authentication method, without the need for method- specific code, which resides on the RADIUS server.  While EAP was originally developed for use with PPP, it is now also in use with IEEE 802.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP.  EAP provides its own support for duplicate elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees.  Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual EAP methods may support this.  This document obsoletes RFC 2284.  A summary of the changes between this document and RFC 2284 is available in Appendix A. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
