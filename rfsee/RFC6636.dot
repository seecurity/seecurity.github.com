Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) Multicast
Handover Optimization by the
Subscription Information Acquisition
through the LMA (SIAL)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7161.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies an experimental multicast handover optimization mechanism for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) to accelerate the delivery of multicast traffic to mobile nodes after handovers.  The mechanism, called Subscription Information Acquisition through the LMA (SIAL), is based on speeding up the acquisition of mobile nodes' multicast context by the mobile access gateways.  To do that, extensions to the current PMIPv6 protocol are proposed.  These extensions are not only applicable to the base solution for multicast support in Proxy Mobile IPv6, but they can also be applied to other solutions developed to avoid the tunnel convergence problem.  Furthermore, these extensions are also independent of the role played by the mobile access gateway within the multicast network (acting as either multicast listener discovery proxy or multicast router)."];

Group Communication for the Constrained
Application Protocol (CoAP)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7390.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for constrained devices and constrained networks.  It is anticipated that constrained devices will often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building automation scenario, all lights in a given room may need to be switched on/off as a group).  This specification defines how CoAP should be used in a group communication context.  An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed based on existing CoAP functionality as well as new features introduced in this specification.  Also, various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate important concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for deployment in various network topologies."];
