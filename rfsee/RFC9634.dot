Deterministic Networking Architecture
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8655.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency within a network domain.  Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the network topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in spite of the loss of a path.  DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time- Sensitive Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1."];

Framework of Operations, Administration,

This document's primary purpose is to detail the specific requirements of the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) recommended to maintain a deterministic network.  The document will be used in future work that defines the applicability of and extension of OAM protocols for a deterministic network.  With the implementation of the OAM framework in DetNet, an operator will have a real-time view of the network infrastructure regarding the network's ability to respect the Service Level Objective (SLO), such as packet delay, delay variation, and packet-loss ratio, assigned to each DetNet flow."];
