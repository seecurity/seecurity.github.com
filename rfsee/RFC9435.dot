A Lower-Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB)
for Differentiated Services
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8622.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Lower- Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB). The primary objective of this LE PHB is to protect Best-Effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with the default PHB) from LE traffic in congestion situations, i.e., when resources become scarce, BE traffic has precedence over LE traffic and may preempt it. Alternatively, packets forwarded by the LE PHB can be associated with a scavenger service class, i.e., they scavenge otherwise-unused resources only. There are numerous uses for this PHB, e.g., for background traffic of low precedence, such as bulk data transfers with low priority in time, non-time-critical backups, larger software updates, web search engines while gathering information from web servers and so on. This document recommends a standard Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value for the LE PHB.

Guidelines for Writing an IANA

To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.

A Lower Effort Per-Domain Behavior (PDB)

This is in contrast to the Internet's best-effort or normal Internet traffic model, where prolonged starvation indicates network problems.  In this sense, the proposed PDB's traffic is forwarded with a lower priority than the normal best-effort Internet traffic, thus the PDB is called Lower Effort (LE).  Use of this PDB permits a network operator to strictly limit the effect of its traffic on best-effort/normal or all other Internet traffic.  This document gives some example uses, but does not propose constraining the PDB's use to any particular type of traffic."];
