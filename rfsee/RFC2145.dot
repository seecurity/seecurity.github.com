Planning for Protocol Adoption and

Many protocols and technologies were not designed to enable smooth transition to alternatives or to easily deploy extensions; thus, some transitions, such as the introduction of IPv6, have been difficult.  This document attempts to summarize some basic principles to enable future transitions, and it also summarizes what makes for a good transition plan."];
