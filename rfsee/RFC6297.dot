A Lower Effort Per-Domain Behavior (PDB)
for Differentiated Services
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3662.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document proposes a differentiated services per-domain behavior (PDB) whose traffic may be starved (although starvation is not strictly required) in a properly functioning network.  This is in contrast to the Internet's best-effort or normal Internet traffic model, where prolonged starvation indicates network problems.  In this sense, the proposed PDB's traffic is forwarded with a lower priority than the normal best-effort Internet traffic, thus the PDB is called Lower Effort (LE).  Use of this PDB permits a network operator to strictly limit the effect of its traffic on best-effort/normal or all other Internet traffic.  This document gives some example uses, but does not propose constraining the PDB's use to any particular type of traffic."];

LEDBAT uses changes in one-way delay measurements to limit congestion that the flow itself induces in the network.  LEDBAT is designed for use by background bulk-transfer applications to be no more aggressive than standard TCP congestion control (as specified in RFC 5681) and to yield in the presence of competing flows, thus limiting interference with the network performance of competing flows.

The document also surveys the technologies deployed in these networks, and their differing architectural characteristics, including a set of definitions and shared properties.

A Lower-Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB)
for Differentiated Services
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8622.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Lower- Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB). The primary objective of this LE PHB is to protect Best-Effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with the default PHB) from LE traffic in congestion situations, i.e., when resources become scarce, BE traffic has precedence over LE traffic and may preempt it. Alternatively, packets forwarded by the LE PHB can be associated with a scavenger service class, i.e., they scavenge otherwise-unused resources only. There are numerous uses for this PHB, e.g., for background traffic of low precedence, such as bulk data transfers with low priority in time, non-time-critical backups, larger software updates, web search engines while gathering information from web servers and so on. This document recommends a standard Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value for the LE PHB. This specification obsoletes RFC 3662 and updates the DSCP recommended in RFCs 4594 and 8325 to use the DSCP assigned in this specification."];

FEC coding can help deal with losses at the end of transfers or with networks having non-congestion losses. However, FEC coding mechanisms should not hide congestion signals. This memo offers a discussion of how FEC coding and congestion control can coexist. Another objective is to encourage the research community to also consider congestion control aspects when proposing and comparing FEC coding solutions in communication systems.
