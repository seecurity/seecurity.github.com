It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow controlled, and is structured to provide maximum throughput over a wide variety of networks.

NETBLT: A bulk data transfer protocol

It is a revision of the specification published in RFC-969.  NETBLT (NETwork BLock Transfer) is a transport level protocol intended for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data between computers.  It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow controlled, and is designed to provide maximum throughput over a wide variety of networks.  Although NETBLT currently runs on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), it should be able to operate on top of any datagram protocol similar in function to IP.  This document is published for discussion and comment, and does not constitute a standard.  The proposal may change and certain parts of the protocol have not yet been specified; implementation of this document is therefore not advised.  Obsoletes RFC-969."];
