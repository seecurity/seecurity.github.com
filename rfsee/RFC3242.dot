Zero-byte Support for Bidirectional

Layer Assisted RObust Header Compression
(ROHC) Profile
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3408.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines an additional mode of the link-layer assisted RObust Header Compression (ROHC) profile, also known as the zero-byte profile, beyond the two defined in RFC 3242.  Zero-byte header compression exists in order to prevent the single-octet ROHC header from pushing a packet voice stream into the next higher fixed packet size for the radio.  It is usable in certain widely deployed older air interfaces.  This document adds the zero-byte operation for ROHC Bidirectional Reliable mode (R-mode) to the ones specified for Unidirectional (U-mode) and Bidirectional Optimistic (O-mode) modes of header compression in RFC 3242.
