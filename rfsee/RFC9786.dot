LDP Specification

A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through them.  This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has made.  This document defines a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths.

Segment Routing Architecture
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8402.html", target="_top", tooltip="Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called segments. A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service based. A segment can have a semantic local to an SR node or global within an SR domain. SR provides a mechanism that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological path, while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SR domain. SR can be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change to the forwarding plane. A segment is encoded as an MPLS label. An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels. The segment to process is on the top of the stack. Upon completion of a segment, the related label is popped from the stack. SR can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header. A segment is encoded as an IPv6 address. An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing header. The active segment is indicated by the Destination Address (DA) of the packet. The next active segment is indicated by a pointer in the new routing header."];

Preference-Based EVPN Designated
Forwarder (DF) Election
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9785.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Designated Forwarder (DF) in Ethernet Virtual Private Networks (EVPNs) is defined as the Provider Edge (PE) router responsible for sending Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast (BUM) traffic to a multihomed device/network in the case of an All-Active multihoming Ethernet Segment (ES) or BUM and unicast in the case of Single-Active multihoming. The Designated Forwarder is selected out of a candidate list of PEs that advertise the same Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) to the EVPN network, according to the default DF election algorithm. While the default algorithm provides an efficient and automated way of selecting the Designated Forwarder across different Ethernet Tags in the Ethernet Segment, there are some use cases where a more deterministic and user-controlled method is required. At the same time, Network Operators require an easy way to force an on-demand Designated Forwarder switchover in order to carry out some maintenance tasks on the existing Designated Forwarder or control whether a new active PE can preempt the existing Designated Forwarder PE. This document proposes use of a DF election algorithm that meets the requirements of determinism and operation control. This document updates RFC 8584 by modifying the definition of the DF Election Extended Community."];

Fast Recovery for EVPN Designated

These procedures have been enhanced further by applying the Highest Random Weight (HRW) algorithm for DF election to avoid unnecessary DF status changes upon a failure. This document improves these procedures by providing a fast DF election upon recovery of the failed link or node associated with the multihomed Ethernet Segment. This document updates RFC 8584 by optionally introducing delays between some of the events therein. The solution is independent of the number of EVPN Instances (EVIs) associated with that Ethernet Segment, and it is performed via a simple signaling in BGP between the recovered node and each of the other nodes in the multihoming group."];
