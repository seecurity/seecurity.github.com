RFC Editor Model (Version 1)
2009", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be carried out by various persons or entities.  The RFC Editor model presented in this document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into four functions: The RFC Series Editor, the Independent Submission Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher.  It also introduces the RFC Series Advisory Group and an (optional) Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board.  The model outlined here is intended to increase flexibility and operational support options, provide for the orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality and timely processing, ensuring document accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost transparency.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Defining the Role and Function of IETF
Protocol Parameter Registry Operators
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6220.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols make use of commonly defined values that are passed in messages or packets.  To ensure consistent interpretation of these values between independent implementations, there is a need to ensure that the values and associated semantic intent are uniquely defined.  The IETF uses registry functions to record assigned protocol parameter values and their associated semantic intentions.  For each IETF protocol parameter, it is current practice for the IETF to delegate the role of Protocol Parameter Registry Operator to a nominated entity.  This document provides a description of, and the requirements for, these delegated functions.
