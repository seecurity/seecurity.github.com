Application Techniques for Checking and

The introduction of new top-level domains, especially non-country-code ones, has exposed flaws in some of the methods used by these applications.  These flaws make it more difficult, or impossible, for users of the applications to access the full Internet.

National and Local Characters for DNS
Top Level Domain (TLD) Names

This document reviews some of the motivations for such domains, several suggestions that have been made to provide needed functionality, and the constraints that the DNS imposes.  It then suggests an alternative, local translation, that may solve a superset of the problem while avoiding protocol changes, serious deployment delays, and other difficulties.  The suggestion utilizes a localization technique in applications to permit any TLD to be accessed using the vocabulary and characters of any language.  It is not restricted to language- or country-specific multilingual TLDs in the language(s) and script(s) of that country.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8126.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters. To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry. This is the third edition of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226."];
