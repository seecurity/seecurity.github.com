Energy Management (EMAN) Applicability
Statement

This document presents the applicability of the EMAN information model in a variety of scenarios with cases and target devices.  These use cases are useful for identifying requirements for the framework and MIBs.  Further, we describe the relationship of the EMAN framework to other relevant energy monitoring standards and architectures.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Energy Management Framework

The framework presents a physical reference model and information model.  The information model consists of an Energy Management Domain as a set of Energy Objects.  Each Energy Object can be attributed with identity, classification, and context.  Energy Objects can be monitored and controlled with respect to power, Power State, energy, demand, Power Attributes, and battery.  Additionally, the framework models relationships and capabilities between Energy Objects."];

Monitoring functions include identifying energy-managed devices and their components, as well as monitoring their Power States, Power Inlets, Power Outlets, actual power, Power Attributes, received energy, provided energy, and contained batteries. Control functions include such functions as controlling power supply and Power State of energy-managed devices and their components.
