X.509 Key and Signature Encoding for the

X.509 certificates (RFC 5280) can be directly used in the Authorizer or Licensees field (or in both fields) in a KeyNote assertion, allowing for easy integration with protocols that already use X.509 certificates for authentication. In addition, the document defines additional signature types that use other hash functions (beyond the MD5 and SHA1 hash functions that are defined in RFC 2792).

Standard certificate extensions are described and two Internet-specific extensions are defined.  A set of required certificate extensions is specified.
