This information model is maintained as the IANA IPFIX Information Elements registry, the initial contents of which were defined by RFC 5102.  This information model is used by the IPFIX protocol for encoding measured traffic information and information related to the traffic Observation Point, the traffic Metering Process, and the Exporting Process.  Although this model was developed for the IPFIX protocol, it is defined in an open way that allows it to be easily used in other protocols, interfaces, and applications.
