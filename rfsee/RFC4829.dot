Label Switched Path (LSP) Preemption
Policies for MPLS Traffic Engineering
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="When the establishment of a higher priority (Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path) TE LSP requires the preemption of a set of lower priority TE LSPs, a node has to make a local decision to select which TE LSPs will be preempted.  The preempted LSPs are then rerouted by their respective \%Head-end Label Switch Router (LSR).  This document presents a flexible policy that can be used to achieve different objectives: preempt the lowest priority LSPs; preempt the minimum number of LSPs; preempt the set of TE LSPs that provide the closest amount of bandwidth to the required bandwidth for the preempting TE LSPs (to minimize bandwidth wastage); preempt the LSPs that will have the maximum chance to get rerouted.  Simulation results are given and a comparison among several different policies, with respect to preemption cascading, number of preempted LSPs, priority, wasted bandwidth and blocking probability is also included.

MPLS Traffic Engineering Soft Preemption

Initially, MPLS RSVP-TE was defined with support for only immediate TE LSP displacement upon preemption.  The utilization of a reroute request notification helps more gracefully mitigate the reroute process of preempted TE LSP.  For the brief period soft preemption is activated, reservations (though not necessarily traffic levels) are in effect under-provisioned until the TE LSP(s) can be rerouted.  For this reason, the feature is primarily, but not exclusively, interesting in MPLS-enabled IP networks with Differentiated Services and Traffic Engineering capabilities. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
