This specification also updates RFC 5580 to allow the Operator-Name attribute in CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request packets."];

We do this by naming the data types defined in RFC 6158, which have been used since at least the publication of RFC 2865.  We provide an IANA registry for the data types and update the RADIUS Attribute Types registry to include a Data Type field for each attribute.  Finally, we recommend that authors of RADIUS specifications use these types in preference to existing practice.  This document updates RFCs 2865, 3162, 4072, 6158, 6572, and 7268."];
