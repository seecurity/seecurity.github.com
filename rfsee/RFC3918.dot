Methodology for IP Multicast
Benchmarking
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The purpose of this document is to describe methodology specific to the benchmarking of multicast IP forwarding devices. It builds upon the tenets set forth in RFC 2544, RFC 2432 and other IETF Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) efforts. This document seeks to extend these efforts to the multicast paradigm. The BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents. The Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related terms. The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents. This memo provides information for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Benchmarking Virtual Switches in the
Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV)
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8204.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo describes the contributions of the Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV) project on Virtual Switch Performance (VSPERF), particularly in the areas of test setups and configuration parameters for the system under test.  This project has extended the current and completed work of the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group in the IETF and references existing literature.  The Benchmarking Methodology Working Group has traditionally conducted laboratory characterization of dedicated physical implementations of internetworking functions.  Therefore, this memo describes the additional considerations when virtual switches are implemented on general-purpose hardware.  The expanded tests and benchmarks are also influenced by the OPNFV mission to support virtualization of the telco infrastructure."];

Many of these terms and methods may be applicable to network equipment beyond the scope of this document as the technologies originally applied in the data center are deployed elsewhere."];
