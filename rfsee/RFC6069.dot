Making TCP More Robust to Long
Connectivity Disruptions (TCP-LCD)
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Disruptions in end-to-end path connectivity, which last longer than one retransmission timeout, cause suboptimal TCP performance. The reason for this performance degradation is that TCP interprets segment loss induced by long connectivity disruptions as a sign of congestion, resulting in repeated retransmission timer backoffs. This, in turn, leads to a delayed detection of the re-establishment of the connection since TCP waits for the next retransmission timeout before it attempts a retransmission. This document proposes an algorithm to make TCP more robust to long connectivity disruptions (TCP-LCD). It describes how standard ICMP messages can be exploited during timeout-based loss recovery to disambiguate true congestion loss from non-congestion loss caused by connectivity disruptions. Moreover, a reversion strategy of the retransmission timer is specified that enables a more prompt detection of whether or not the connectivity to a previously disconnected peer node has been restored. TCP-LCD is a TCP sender- only modification that effectively improves TCP performance in the case of connectivity disruptions. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

The NewReno Modification to TCP's Fast

The main change in this document relative to RFC 2582 is to specify the Careful variant of NewReno's Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery algorithms.  The base algorithm described in RFC 2582 did not attempt to avoid unnecessary multiple Fast Retransmits that can occur after a timeout.  However, RFC 2582 also defined Careful and Less Careful variants that avoid these unnecessary Fast Retransmits, and recommended the Careful variant.  This document specifies the previously-named Careful variant as the basic version of NewReno TCP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The Eifel Detection Algorithm for TCP
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3522.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Eifel detection algorithm allows a TCP sender to detect a posteriori whether it has entered loss recovery unnecessarily.  It requires that the TCP Timestamps option defined in RFC 1323 be enabled for a connection.  The Eifel detection algorithm makes use of the fact that the TCP Timestamps option eliminates the retransmission ambiguity in TCP.  Based on the timestamp of the first acceptable ACK that arrives during loss recovery, it decides whether loss recovery was entered unnecessarily.  The Eifel detection algorithm provides a basis for future TCP enhancements.  This includes response algorithms to back out of loss recovery by restoring a TCP sender's congestion control state.

In addition, the Eifel response algorithm restores the congestion control state in such a way that packet bursts are avoided. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Forward RTO-Recovery (F-RTO): An
Algorithm for Detecting Spurious
Retransmission Timeouts with TCP
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5682.html", target="_top", tooltip="The purpose of this document is to move the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) functionality for TCP in RFC 4138 from Experimental to Standards Track status. The F-RTO support for Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) in RFC 4138 remains with Experimental status. See Appendix B for the differences between this document and RFC 4138. Spurious retransmission timeouts cause suboptimal TCP performance because they often result in unnecessary retransmission of the last window of data. This document describes the F-RTO detection algorithm for detecting spurious TCP retransmission timeouts. F-RTO is a TCP sender-only algorithm that does not require any TCP options to operate. After retransmitting the first unacknowledged segment triggered by a timeout, the F-RTO algorithm of the TCP sender monitors the incoming acknowledgments to determine whether the timeout was spurious. It then decides whether to send new segments or retransmit unacknowledged segments. The algorithm effectively helps to avoid additional unnecessary retransmissions and thereby improves TCP performance in the case of a spurious timeout. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
