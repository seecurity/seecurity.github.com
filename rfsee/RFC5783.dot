HighSpeed TCP for Large Congestion

This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP's congestion control mechanism for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows.  The congestion control mechanisms of the current Standard TCP constrains the congestion windows that can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments.  For example, for a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packets and a 100 ms round-trip time, achieving a steady-state throughput of 10 Gbps would require an average congestion window of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at most one congestion event every 5,000,000,000 packets (or equivalently, at most one congestion event every 1 2/3 hours).  This is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint.

Such an increase can easily result in thousands of packets being dropped in one round-trip time.  This is often counter-productive for the TCP flow itself, and is also hard on the rest of the traffic sharing the congested link.

TCP Performance Implications of Network
Path Asymmetry

These problems arise in several access networks, including bandwidth-asymmetric networks and packet radio subnetworks, for different underlying reasons.

These solutions use a combination of local link- layer techniques, subnetwork, and end-to-end mechanisms, consisting of: (i) techniques to manage the channel used for the upstream bottleneck link carrying the ACKs, typically using header compression or reducing the frequency of TCP ACKs, (ii) techniques to handle this reduced ACK frequency to retain the TCP sender's acknowledgment-triggered self- clocking and (iii) techniques to schedule the data and ACK packets in the reverse direction to improve performance in the presence of two-way traffic.

While Quick-Start is designed to be used by a range of transport protocols, in this document we only specify its use with TCP. Quick-Start is designed to allow connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers along the path approve the Quick-Start Request. This document describes many paths where Quick-Start Requests would not be approved. These paths include all paths containing routers, IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start. These paths also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing IP options. Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that include multi-access layer- two networks. This document also describes environments where the Quick-Start process could fail with false positives, with the sender incorrectly assuming that the Quick-Start Request had been approved by all of the routers along the path. As a result of these concerns, and as a result of the difficulties and seeming absence of motivation for routers, such as core routers to deploy Quick-Start, Quick-Start is being proposed as a mechanism that could be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet.

Wave and Equation Based Rate Control
(WEBRC) Building Block
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3738.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC), which provides rate and congestion control for data delivery.  WEBRC is specifically designed to support protocols using IP multicast.  It provides multiple-rate, congestion-controlled delivery to receivers, i.e., different receivers joined to the same session may be receiving packets at different rates depending on the bandwidths of their individual connections to the sender and on competing traffic along these connections.  WEBRC requires no feedback from receivers to the sender, i.e., it is a completely receiver-driven congestion control protocol.  Thus, it is designed to scale to potentially massive numbers of receivers attached to a session from a single sender.  Furthermore, because each individual receiver adjusts to the available bandwidth between the sender and that receiver, there is the potential to deliver data to each individual receiver at the fastest possible rate for that receiver, even in a highly heterogeneous network architecture, using a single sender.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

TCP-Friendly Multicast Congestion
Control (TFMCC): Protocol Specification
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4654.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies TCP-Friendly Multicast Congestion Control (TFMCC).  TFMCC is a congestion control mechanism for multicast transmissions in a best-effort Internet environment.  It is a single-rate congestion control scheme, where the sending rate is adapted to the receiver experiencing the worst network conditions.  TFMCC is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows and has a relatively low variation of throughput over time, making it suitable for applications where a relatively smooth sending rate is of importance, such as streaming media.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Specifying New Congestion Control
Algorithms
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5033.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks).  Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes that significantly differ from the IETF's congestion control principles.  Using these new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications to both the traffic using the new congestion control and to traffic using the currently standardized congestion control.  Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing with alternate congestion control proposals.  The goal of this document is to provide guidance for considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];

Metrics for the Evaluation of Congestion
Control Mechanisms
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5166.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the metrics to be considered in an evaluation of new or modified congestion control mechanisms for the Internet. These include metrics for the evaluation of new transport protocols, of proposed modifications to TCP, of application-level congestion control, and of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms in the router. This document is the first in a series of documents aimed at improving the models that we use in the evaluation of transport protocols. This document is a product of the Transport Modeling Research Group (TMRG), and has received detailed feedback from many members of the Research Group (RG). As the document tries to make clear, there is not necessarily a consensus within the research community (or the IETF community, the vendor community, the operations community, or any other community) about the metrics that congestion control mechanisms should be designed to optimize, in terms of trade-offs between throughput and delay, fairness between competing flows, and the like. However, we believe that there is a clear consensus that congestion control mechanisms should be evaluated in terms of trade-offs between a range of metrics, rather than in terms of optimizing for a single metric. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
