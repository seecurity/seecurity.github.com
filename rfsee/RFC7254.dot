A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for

The IMEI and IMEISV were introduced as part of the specification for the GSM and are also now incorporated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as part of the 3GPP specification for GSM, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), and 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks.  The IMEI and IMEISV are used to uniquely identify Mobile Equipment within these systems and are managed by the GSMA.  URNs from this namespace almost always contain personally identifiable information and need to be treated accordingly.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Uniform Resource Names (URNs)

With regard to URN syntax, this document defines the canonical syntax for URNs (in a way that is consistent with URI syntax), specifies methods for determining URN-equivalence, and discusses URI conformance.  With regard to URN namespaces, this document specifies a method for defining a URN namespace and associating it with a namespace identifier, and it describes procedures for registering namespace identifiers with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  This document obsoletes both RFCs 2141 and 3406."];
