INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL -
VERSION 4rev1
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3501.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.  IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders.  IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server.  IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC 2822 and RFC 2045 parsing, searching, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of numbers.  These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers.  IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A mechanism for accessing configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is discussed in RFC 2244.  IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as RFC 2821. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

IMAP Extension for Referencing the Last
SEARCH Result
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5182.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many IMAP clients use the result of a SEARCH command as the input to perform another operation, for example, fetching the found messages, deleting them, or copying them to another mailbox. This can be achieved using standard IMAP operations described in RFC 3501; however, this would be suboptimal. The server will send the list of found messages to the client; after that, the client will have to parse the list, reformat it, and send it back to the server. The client can't pipeline the SEARCH command with the subsequent command, and, as a result, the server might not be able to perform some optimizations. This document proposes an IMAP extension that allows a client to tell a server to use the result of a SEARCH (or Unique Identifier (UID) SEARCH) command as an input to any subsequent command.
