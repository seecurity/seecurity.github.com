OSPF Graceful Link Shutdown

Increasing the metric to the highest value on one side of the link is not sufficient to divert the traffic flowing in the other direction. It is useful for the routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to be able to advertise a link as being in a graceful-shutdown state to indicate impending maintenance activity on the link. This information can be used by the network devices to reroute the traffic effectively.
