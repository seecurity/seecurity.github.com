Proxy Mobile IPv6 Extensions for
Distributed Mobility Management
2020", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow networks to be set up in such a way that traffic is distributed optimally and centrally deployed anchors are not relied upon to provide IP mobility support. There are many different approaches to address Distributed Mobility Management -- for example, extending network-based mobility protocols (like Proxy Mobile IPv6) or client-based mobility protocols (like Mobile IPv6), among others. This document follows the former approach and proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6, in which mobility sessions are anchored at the last IP hop router (called the mobility anchor and access router). The mobility anchor and access router is an enhanced access router that is also able to operate as a local mobility anchor or mobility access gateway on a per-prefix basis. The document focuses on the required extensions to effectively support the simultaneous anchoring several flows at different distributed gateways.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Requirements for Distributed Mobility
Management
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7333.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the requirements for Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) at the network layer.  The hierarchical structure in traditional wireless networks has led primarily to centrally deployed mobility anchors.  As some wireless networks are evolving away from the hierarchical structure, it can be useful to have a distributed model for mobility management in which traffic does not need to traverse centrally deployed mobility anchors far from the optimal route.  The motivation and the problems addressed by each requirement are also described."];

Mobility Support in IPv6
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6275.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Mobile IPv6, a protocol that allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.

Default Address Selection for Internet
Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)

The algorithms specify default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations.

The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior. In dual-stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses -- depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice versa.

In a distributed mobility anchoring environment, multiple anchors are available for mid-session switching of an IP prefix anchor.  To start a new flow or to handle a flow not requiring IP session continuity as a mobile node moves to a new network, the flow can be started or restarted using an IP address configured from the new IP prefix anchored to the new network.  If the flow needs to survive the change of network, there are solutions that can be used to enable IP address mobility.  This document describes different anchoring approaches, depending on the IP mobility needs, and how this IP address mobility is handled by the network."];
