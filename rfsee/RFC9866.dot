Root Node Failure Detector (RNFD): Fast
Detection of Border Router Crashes in
the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and
Lossy Networks (RPL)
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="By and large, correct operation of a network running the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) requires border routers to be up.  In many applications, it is beneficial for the nodes to detect a failure of a border router as soon as possible to trigger fallback actions.  This document specifies the Root Node Failure Detector (RNFD), an extension to RPL that expedites detection of border router crashes by having nodes collaboratively monitor the status of a given border router.  The extension introduces an additional state at each node, a new type of RPL Control Message Option for synchronizing this state among different nodes, and the coordination algorithm itself."];

RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power
and Lossy Networks
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6550.html", target="_top", tooltip="Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which both the routers and their interconnect are constrained.  LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power).  Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability.  LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers.  Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point).  This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported.  Support for point-to-point traffic is also available. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

An IPv6 Routing Header for Source Routes

In some configurations, it is necessary to use these memory-constrained routers to deliver datagrams to nodes within the LLN.  The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) can be used in some deployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g., the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or a few routers and forward the IPv6 datagram using a source routing technique to avoid large routing tables on memory-constrained routers.

Dynamically adjusting transmission windows allows Trickle to spread new information on the scale of link-layer transmission times while sending only a few messages per hour when information does not change.  A simple suppression mechanism and transmission point selection allow Trickle's communication rate to scale logarithmically with density.

Unified Layer 2 (L2) Abstractions for

2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5184.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document proposes unified Layer 2 (L2) abstractions for Layer 3 (L3)-driven fast handovers.  For efficient network communication, it is vital for a protocol layer to know or utilize other layers' information, such as the form of L2 triggers.  However, each protocol layer is basically designed independently.  Since each protocol layer is also implemented independently in current operating systems, it is very hard to exchange control information between protocol layers.  This document defines nine kinds of L2 abstractions in the form of primitives to achieve fast handovers in the network layer as a means of solving the problem.  This mechanism is called L3-driven fast handovers because the network layer initiates L2 and L3 handovers by using the primitives.  This document is a product of the IP Mobility Optimizations (MobOpts) Research Group.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];
