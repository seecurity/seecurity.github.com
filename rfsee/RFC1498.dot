On the Naming and Binding of Network
Destinations

It suggests two ideas: First, it is helpful to distinguish among four different kinds of objects that may be named as the destination of a packet in a network.  Second, the operating system concept of binding is a useful way to describe the relations among the four kinds of objects.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
