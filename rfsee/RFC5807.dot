The master key is derived from the Master Session Key of the Extensible Authentication Protocol as a result of successful PANA authentication.  The master key guarantees cryptographic independence among enforcement points bootstrapped from PANA authentication across different address families. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP.  EAP provides its own support for duplicate elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees.  Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual EAP methods may support this.  This document obsoletes RFC 2284.

The guidance is also useful to designers of systems and solutions that include AAA key management protocols.  Given the complexity and difficulty in designing secure, long-lasting key management algorithms and protocols by experts in the field, it is almost certainly inappropriate for IETF working groups without deep expertise in the area to be designing their own key management algorithms and protocols based on Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocols.  The guidelines in this document apply to documents requesting publication as IETF RFCs.  Further, these guidelines will be useful to other standards development organizations (SDOs) that specify AAA key management.
