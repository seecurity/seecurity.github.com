OSPF as the Provider/Customer Edge
Protocol for BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private
Networks (VPNs)
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Many Service Providers offer Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to their customers, using a technique in which customer edge routers (CE routers) are routing peers of provider edge routers (PE routers). The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to distribute the customer's routes across the provider's IP backbone network, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer packets across the provider's backbone. This is known as a BGP/MPLS IP VPN. The base specification for BGP/MPLS IP VPNs presumes that the routing protocol on the interface between a PE router and a CE router is BGP. This document extends that specification by allowing the routing protocol on the PE/CE interface to be the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol. This document updates RFC 4364.

Increasing the metric to the highest value on one side of the link is not sufficient to divert the traffic flowing in the other direction.

Distribution of Link-State and Traffic
Engineering Information Using BGP

This is achieved using a BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding format. The mechanism applies to physical and virtual (e.g., tunnel) IGP links. The mechanism described is subject to policy control. Applications of this technique include Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) servers and Path Computation Elements (PCEs).
