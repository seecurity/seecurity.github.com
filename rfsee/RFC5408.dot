MIKEY-IBAKE: Identity-Based
Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) Mode
of Key Distribution in Multimedia
Internet KEYing (MIKEY)
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6267.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a key management protocol variant for the Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol that relies on a trusted key management service.  In particular, this variant utilizes Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) framework that allows the participating clients to perform mutual authentication and derive a session key in an asymmetric Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) framework.  This protocol, in addition to providing mutual authentication, eliminates the key escrow problem that is common in standard IBE and provides perfect forward and backward secrecy.

IBAKE: Identity-Based Authenticated Key
Exchange
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6539.html", target="_top", tooltip="Cryptographic protocols based on public-key methods have been traditionally based on certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to support certificate management.  The emerging field of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) protocols allows simplification of infrastructure requirements via a Private-Key Generator (PKG) while providing the same flexibility.  However, one significant limitation of IBE methods is that the PKG can end up being a de facto key escrow server, with undesirable consequences.  Another observed deficiency is a lack of mutual authentication of communicating parties.  This document specifies the Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) protocol.  IBAKE does not suffer from the key escrow problem and in addition provides mutual authentication as well as perfect forward and backward secrecy.
