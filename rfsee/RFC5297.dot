Synthetic Initialization Vector (SIV)
Authenticated Encryption Using the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This memo describes SIV (Synthetic Initialization Vector), a block cipher mode of operation.  SIV takes a key, a plaintext, and multiple variable-length octet strings that will be authenticated but not encrypted.  It produces a ciphertext having the same length as the plaintext and a synthetic initialization vector.  Depending on how it is used, SIV achieves either the goal of deterministic authenticated encryption or the goal of nonce-based, misuse-resistant authenticated encryption.

Instead, a minimal implementation is expected to be optimized for constrained environments while remaining interoperable with implementations of ESP.
