DISCOVER: Supporting Multicast DNS
Queries
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the DISCOVER opcode, an experimental extension to the Domain Name System (DNS) to use multicast queries for resource discovery.  This opcode was tested in experiments run during 1995 and 1996 for the Topology Based Domain Search (TBDS) project.  This project is no longer active and there are no current plans to restart it.  TBDS was the first known use of multicast transport for DNS.  A client multicasts a DNS query using the DISCOVER opcode and processes the multiple responses that may result.  This document defines a Historic Document for the Internet community."];
