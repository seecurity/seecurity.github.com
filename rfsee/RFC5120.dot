RIFT: Routing in Fat Trees
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9692.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a specialized, dynamic routing protocol for Clos, fat tree, and variants thereof.  These topologies were initially used within crossbar interconnects and consequently router and switch backplanes, but their characteristics make them ideal for constructing IP fabrics as well.  The protocol specified by this document is optimized towards the minimization of control plane state to support very large substrates as well as the minimization of configuration and operational complexity to allow for a simplified deployment of said topologies."];

IGP Flexible Algorithms: Bandwidth,
Delay, Metrics, and Constraints
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9843.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many networks configure the IGP link metric relative to the link capacity, and high bandwidth traffic gets routed per the link capacity. Flexible Algorithms provide mechanisms to create constraint-based paths in an IGP. This specification documents a generic metric-type and a set of bandwidth-related constraints to be used in Flexible Algorithms. This document updates RFC 9350."];

Multi-Part TLVs in IS-IS
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9885.html", target="_top", tooltip="New technologies are adding new information into IS-IS while deployment scales are simultaneously increasing.  This causes the contents of many critical TLVs to exceed the currently supported limit of 255 octets.  This document codifies the common mechanism of extending the TLV content space through multiple TLVs."];
