Both information communicated with the encoded data itself and information that needs to be communicated 'out-of-band' are considered.  The procedures for specifying new FEC codes, defining the information communication requirements associated with those codes and registering them with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) are also described.  The requirements on Content Delivery Protocols that wish to use FEC codes defined within this framework are also defined.  The companion document titled The Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) in Reliable Multicast describes some applications of FEC codes for delivering content.  This document obsoletes RFC 3452.
