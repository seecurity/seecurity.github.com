Internet Code Point (ICP) Assignments

In the first task, this document is a partial replacement for RFC 1888 -- particularly for section 6 of RFC 1888.  In the second task, this document incorporates wording and specifications from ITU-T Recommendation X.213 and further recommends that IANA use the IETF consensus assignment policy in making future ICP assignments.
