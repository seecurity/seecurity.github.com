TinyMT32 Pseudorandom Number Generator
(PRNG)
2020", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the TinyMT32 Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG), which produces 32-bit pseudorandom unsigned integers and aims at having a simple-to-use and deterministic solution.  This PRNG is a small-sized variant of the Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNG.  The main advantage of TinyMT32 over MT is the use of a small internal state, compatible with most target platforms that include embedded devices, while keeping reasonably good randomness that represents a significant improvement compared to the Park-Miller Linear Congruential PRNG.  However, neither the TinyMT nor MT PRNG is meant to be used for cryptographic applications.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Low Density Parity Check (LDPC)

These systematic FEC codes belong to the well- known class of Low Density Parity Check codes, and are large block FEC codes in the sense of RFC 3453. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Sliding Window Random Linear Code (RLC)
Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) Schemes
for FECFRAME

They can protect arbitrary media streams along the lines defined by FECFRAME extended to Sliding Window FEC Codes.  These Sliding Window FEC Codes rely on an encoding window that slides over the source symbols, generating new repair symbols whenever needed.  Compared to block FEC codes, these Sliding Window FEC Codes offer key advantages with real-time flows in terms of reduced FEC-related latency while often providing improved packet erasure recovery capabilities."];
