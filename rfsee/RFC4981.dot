Survey of Research towards Robust Peer-
to-Peer Networks: Search Methods
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The pace of research on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking in the last five years warrants a critical survey. P2P has the makings of a disruptive technology -- it can aggregate enormous storage and processing resources while minimizing entry and scaling costs. Failures are common amongst massive numbers of distributed peers, though the impact of individual failures may be less than in conventional architectures. Thus, the key to realizing P2P's potential in applications other than casual file sharing is robustness. P2P search methods are first couched within an overall P2P taxonomy. P2P indexes for simple key lookup are assessed, including those based on Plaxton trees, rings, tori, butterflies, de Bruijn graphs, and skip graphs. Similarly, P2P indexes for keyword lookup, information retrieval and data management are explored. Finally, early efforts to optimize range, multi-attribute, join, and aggregation queries over P2P indexes are reviewed. Insofar as they are available in the primary literature, robustness mechanisms and metrics are highlighted throughout. However, the low-level mechanisms that most affect robustness are not well isolated in the literature. Recommendations are given for future research.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture:
Definition, Taxonomies, Examples, and
Applicability

The survey includes a definition and several taxonomies of P2P systems.  This survey also includes a description of which types of applications can be built with P2P technologies and examples of P2P applications that are currently in use on the Internet.  Finally, we discuss architectural trade-offs and provide guidelines for deciding whether or not a P2P architecture would be suitable to meet the requirements of a given application.

Security Issues and Solutions in Peer-
to-Peer Systems for Realtime
Communications
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5765.html", target="_top", tooltip="Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have become popular for certain applications and deployments for a variety of reasons, including fault tolerance, economics, and legal issues.  It has therefore become reasonable for resource consuming and typically centralized applications like Voice over IP (VoIP) and, in general, realtime communication to adapt and exploit the benefits of P2P.  Such a migration needs to address a new set of P2P-specific security problems.  This document describes some of the known issues found in common P2P networks, analyzing the relevance of such issues and the applicability of existing solutions when using P2P architectures for realtime communication.

A Survey on Research on the Application-
Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
Problem
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6029.html", target="_top", tooltip="A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used originally for file sharing, and more recently for real-time communications and live media streaming.  Such applications discover a route to each other through an overlay network with little knowledge of the underlying network topology.  As a result, they may choose peers based on information deduced from empirical measurements, which can lead to suboptimal choices.  This document, a product of the P2P Research Group, presents a survey of existing literature on discovering and using network topology information for Application-Layer Traffic Optimization.
