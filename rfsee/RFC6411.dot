The one-to-one backup method creates detour LSPs for each protected LSP at each potential point of local repair. The facility backup method creates a bypass tunnel to protect a potential failure point; by taking advantage of MPLS label stacking, this bypass tunnel can protect a set of LSPs that have similar backup constraints. Both methods can be used to protect links and nodes during network failure. The described behavior and extensions to RSVP allow nodes to implement either method or both and to interoperate in a mixed network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

RSVP assumes that both the data sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling.  Yet, there are use cases where resource reservation is required, but the receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable.  This document presents RSVP proxy behaviors allowing RSVP routers to initiate or terminate RSVP signaling on behalf of a receiver or a sender that is not RSVP-capable.  This allows resource reservations to be established on a critical subset of the end-to-end path.  This document reviews conceptual approaches for deploying RSVP proxies and discusses how RSVP reservations can be synchronized with application requirements, despite the sender, receiver, or both not participating in RSVP.  This document also points out where extensions to RSVP (or to other protocols) may be needed for deployment of a given RSVP proxy approach.

There are situations where multiple such aggregate reservations are needed for the same source IP address, destination IP address, and PHB (or set of PHBs).  However, this is not supported by the aggregate reservations defined in RFC 3175.  In order to support this, the present document defines a more flexible type of aggregate RSVP reservations, referred to as generic aggregate reservation.  Multiple such generic aggregate reservations can be established for a given PHB (or set of PHBs) from a given source IP address to a given destination IP address.
