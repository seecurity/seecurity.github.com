Additional Data Related to an Emergency

This document describes data structures and mechanisms to convey such data to the PSAP. The intent is that every emergency call carry as much of the information described here as possible using the mechanisms described here. The mechanisms permit the data to be conveyed by reference (as an external resource) or by value (within the body of a SIP message or a location object). This follows the tradition of prior emergency services standardization work where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling (i.e., in the body of the SIP message) or by reference."];

To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed.

Scoped Interpretation of DNS Resource
Records through Underscored Naming of
Attribute Leaves
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8552.html", target="_top", tooltip="Formally, any DNS Resource Record (RR) may occur under any domain name.  However, some services use an operational convention for defining specific interpretations of an RRset by locating the records in a DNS branch under the parent domain to which the RRset actually applies.  The top of this subordinate branch is defined by a naming convention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with the underscore character (e.g., _name).  The underscored naming construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent domain above the underscored branch.  This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names registry with IANA.  The purpose of this registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the use of the same underscored name for different services."];
