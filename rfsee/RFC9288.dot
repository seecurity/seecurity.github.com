Quick-Start is designed to allow connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers along the path approve the Quick-Start Request. This document describes many paths where Quick-Start Requests would not be approved. These paths include all paths containing routers, IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start. These paths also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing IP options. Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that include multi-access layer- two networks.

Transport
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5971.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies protocol stacks for the routing and transport of per-flow signalling messages along the path taken by that flow through the network.  The design uses existing transport and security protocols under a common messaging layer, the General Internet Signalling Transport (GIST), which provides a common service for diverse signalling applications.  GIST does not handle signalling application state itself, but manages its own internal state and the configuration of the underlying transport and security protocols to enable the transfer of messages in both directions along the flow path.  The combination of GIST and the lower layer transport and security protocols provides a solution for the base protocol component of the Next Steps in Signalling (NSIS) framework.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

IP Router Alert Considerations and Usage
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6398.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IP Router Alert Option is an IP option that alerts transit routers to more closely examine the contents of an IP packet.  The Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP), Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM), the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD), Multicast Router Discovery (MRD), and General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) are some of the protocols that make use of the IP Router Alert Option.  This document discusses security aspects and usage guidelines around the use of the current IP Router Alert Option, thereby updating RFC 2113 and RFC 2711.  Specifically, it provides recommendations against using the Router Alert in the end-to-end open Internet and identifies controlled environments where protocols depending on Router Alert can be used safely.  It also provides recommendations about protection approaches for service providers.  Finally, it provides brief guidelines for Router Alert implementation on routers.  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice."];
