Registration and Administration for

2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3743.html", target="_top", tooltip="Achieving internationalized access to domain names raises many complex issues.  These are associated not only with basic protocol design, such as how names are represented on the network, compared, and converted to appropriate forms, but also with issues and options for deployment, transition, registration, and administration.  The IETF Standards for Internationalized Domain Names, known as IDNA, focuses on access to domain names in a range of scripts that is broader in scope than the original ASCII.  The development process made it clear that use of characters with similar appearances and/or interpretations created potential for confusion, as well as difficulties in deployment and transition.  The conclusion was that, while those issues were important, they could best be addressed administratively rather than through restrictions embedded in the protocols.  This document defines a set of guidelines for applying restrictions of that type for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) scripts and the zones that use them and, perhaps, the beginning of a framework for thinking about other zones, languages, and scripts.
