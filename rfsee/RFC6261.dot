Host Identity Protocol
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5201.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes.  HIP is based on a Sigma-compliant Diffie- Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.  The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the- middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional encryption for upper- layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Basic Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
Extensions for Traversal of Network
Address Translators
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5770.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies extensions to the Host Identity Protocol (HIP) to facilitate Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.  The extensions are based on the use of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) methodology to discover a working path between two end-hosts, and on standard techniques for encapsulating Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets within the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).  This document also defines elements of a procedure for NAT traversal, including the optional use of a HIP relay server.  With these extensions HIP is able to work in environments that have NATs and provides a generic NAT traversal solution to higher-layer networking applications.

Host Identity Protocol Certificates

Additionally, this document specifies the representations of Host Identity Tags in X.509 version 3 (v3) and Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI) certificates. The concrete use of certificates, including how certificates are obtained, requested, and which actions are taken upon successful or failed verification, is specific to the scenario in which the certificates are used.

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.
