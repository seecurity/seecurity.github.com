Discovery (RELOAD)
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7904.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a SIP Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD).  The SIP Usage provides the functionality of a SIP proxy or registrar in a fully distributed system and includes a lookup service for Address of Records (AORs) stored in the overlay.  It also defines Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) that allow the registrations to map an AOR to a specific node reachable through the overlay.  After such initial contact of a Peer, the RELOAD AppAttach method is used to establish a direct connection between nodes through which SIP messages are exchanged."];

A URN Namespace for Device Identity and

The structure of an MEID is 15 hexadecimal digits long and is defined in the 3GPP2 to uniquely identify each individual mobile equipment (e.g., a handset or mobile phone).  The 3GPP2 has a requirement to be able to use an MEID as a URN.  This document fulfills that requirement."];

Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
(STUN)
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8489.html", target="_top", tooltip="Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in dealing with NAT traversal. It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT. It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with many existing NATs and does not require any special behavior from them. STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself. Rather, it is a tool to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution. This document obsoletes RFC 5389."];

Push Notification with the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP)

The document defines new SIP URI parameters to exchange PNS information between the UA and the SIP entity that will then request that push notifications be sent to the UA.  It also defines the parameters to trigger such push notification requests.  The document also defines new feature-capability indicators that can be used to indicate support of this mechanism."];

Interoperability Profile for Relay User
Equipment
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9248.html", target="_top", tooltip="Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by which a hearing person can communicate with a sign language speaker who is deaf, deafblind, or hard of hearing (HoH) or has a speech disability using an interpreter (i.e., a Communications Assistant (CA)) connected via a videophone to the sign language speaker and an audio telephone call to the hearing user.  The CA interprets using sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.  Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency, termed a provider in this document.  The provider also provides a video service that allows users to connect video devices to their service and subsequently to CAs and other sign language speakers.  It is desirable that the videophones used by the sign language speaker conform to a standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that direct video calls between sign language speakers work.  This document describes the interface between a videophone and a provider."];
