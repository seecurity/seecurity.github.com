Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8996.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document formally deprecates Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346). Accordingly, those documents have been moved to Historic status. These versions lack support for current and recommended cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms, and various government and industry profiles of applications using TLS now mandate avoiding these old TLS versions. TLS version 1.2 became the recommended version for IETF protocols in 2008 (subsequently being obsoleted by TLS version 1.3 in 2018), providing sufficient time to transition away from older versions. Removing support for older versions from implementations reduces the attack surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines library and product maintenance. This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC 4347) but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1. This document updates many RFCs that normatively refer to TLS version 1.0 or TLS version 1.1, as described herein. This document also updates the best practices for TLS usage in RFC 7525; hence, it is part of BCP 195."];

MIKEY-IBAKE: Identity-Based
Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) Mode
of Key Distribution in Multimedia
Internet KEYing (MIKEY)
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6267.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a key management protocol variant for the Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol that relies on a trusted key management service.  In particular, this variant utilizes Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) framework that allows the participating clients to perform mutual authentication and derive a session key in an asymmetric Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) framework.  This protocol, in addition to providing mutual authentication, eliminates the key escrow problem that is common in standard IBE and provides perfect forward and backward secrecy.

IBAKE: Identity-Based Authenticated Key
Exchange
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6539.html", target="_top", tooltip="Cryptographic protocols based on public-key methods have been traditionally based on certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to support certificate management.  The emerging field of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) protocols allows simplification of infrastructure requirements via a Private-Key Generator (PKG) while providing the same flexibility.  However, one significant limitation of IBE methods is that the PKG can end up being a de facto key escrow server, with undesirable consequences.  Another observed deficiency is a lack of mutual authentication of communicating parties.  This document specifies the Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) protocol.  IBAKE does not suffer from the key escrow problem and in addition provides mutual authentication as well as perfect forward and backward secrecy.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
