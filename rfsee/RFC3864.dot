Delivered-To Email Header Field
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9228.html", target="_top", tooltip="The address to which email is delivered might be different than any of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were created by the email's author. For example, the address used by the email transport service is provided separately, such as through SMTP's RCPT TO command, and might not match any address in the To: or cc: fields. In addition, before final delivery, handling can entail a sequence of submission/delivery events, using a sequence of different destination addresses that (eventually) lead to the recipient. As well, a receiving system's delivery process can produce local address transformations. It can be helpful for a message to have a common way to record each delivery in such a sequence, noting each address used in the sequence to that recipient, such as for (1) analyzing the path a message has taken, (2) loop detection, or (3) formulating the author's address in a reply message. This document defines a header field for this information. Email handling information discloses details about the email infrastructure, as well as about a particular recipient; this can raise privacy concerns. A header field such as this is not automatically assured of widespread use. Therefore, this document is being published as an Experimental RFC, looking for constituency and for operational utility. This document was produced through the Independent Submission Stream and was not subject to the IETF's approval process."];

Complaint Feedback Loop Address Header
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9477.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a method that allows a Message Originator to specify a Complaint Feedback Loop (CFBL) address as a message header field. It also defines the rules for processing and forwarding such a complaint. The motivation for this arises out of the absence of a standardized and automated way to provide Mailbox Providers with an address for a CFBL. Currently, providing and maintaining such an address is a manual and time-consuming process for Message Originators and Mailbox Providers. The mechanism specified in this document is being published as an experiment to gather feedback and gauge the interest of implementers and deployers. This document is produced through the Independent RFC Stream and was not subject to the IETF's approval process."];

Header Protection for Cryptographically
Protected Email
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9788.html", target="_top", tooltip="S/MIME version 3.1 introduced a mechanism to provide end-to-end cryptographic protection of email message headers. However, few implementations generate messages using this mechanism, and several legacy implementations have revealed rendering or security issues when handling such a message. This document updates the S/MIME specification (RFC 8551) to offer a different mechanism that provides the same cryptographic protections but with fewer downsides when handled by legacy clients. Furthermore, it offers more explicit usability, privacy, and security guidance for clients when generating or handling email messages with cryptographic protection of message headers. The Header Protection scheme defined here is also applicable to messages with PGP/MIME (Pretty Good Privacy with MIME) cryptographic protections."];
