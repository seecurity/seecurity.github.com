Routing and Addressing in Networks with
Global Enterprise Recursion (RANGER)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5720.html", target="_top", tooltip="RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing in networks with global enterprise recursion.  The term enterprise network within this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and deployment scenarios, where an enterprise can be as small as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) network, as dynamic as a Mobile Ad Hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational corporation, or as large as the global Internet itself.  Such networks will require an architected solution for the coordination of routing and addressing plans with accommodations for scalability, provider-independence, mobility, multihoming, and security.  These considerations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the same principles apply even for clean-slate approaches.  The RANGER architecture addresses these requirements and provides a comprehensive framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence.

IPv6 Prefix Length Recommendation for

The length of an IPv6 prefix may be any number from zero to 128, although subnets using stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for address allocation conventionally use a /64 prefix.  Hardware and software implementations of routing and forwarding should therefore impose no rules on prefix length, but implement longest-match-first on prefixes of any valid length."];
