Gateway-Initiated IPv6 Rapid Deployment
on IPv4 Infrastructures (GI 6rd)
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document proposes an alternative IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd) deployment model to that of RFC 5969.  The basic 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to IPv6 networks across an IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels.  6rd requires support by a device (the 6rd customer edge, or 6rd-CE) on the customer site, which must also be assigned an IPv4 address.  The alternative model described in this document initiates the 6-in-4 tunnels from an operator-owned Gateway collocated with the operator's IPv4 network edge rather than from customer equipment, and hence is termed Gateway-initiated 6rd (GI 6rd).  The advantages of this approach are that it requires no modification to customer equipment and avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  The latter point means less pressure on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth environment.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Specification

Key aspects include automatic IPv6 prefix delegation to sites, stateless operation, simple provisioning, and service, which is equivalent to native IPv6 at the sites that are served by the mechanism.

IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4
Infrastructures (6rd)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5569.html", target="_top", tooltip="IPv6 rapid deployment on IPv4 infrastructures (6rd) builds upon mechanisms of 6to4 to enable a service provider to rapidly deploy IPv6 unicast service to IPv4 sites to which it provides customer premise equipment.  Like 6to4, it utilizes stateless IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation in order to transit IPv4-only network infrastructure.  Unlike 6to4, a 6rd service provider uses an IPv6 prefix of its own in place of the fixed 6to4 prefix.  A service provider has used this mechanism for its own IPv6 rapid deployment: five weeks from first exposure to 6rd principles to more than 1,500,000 residential sites being provided native IPv6, under the only condition that they activate it.
