SPAKE2, a Password-Authenticated Key
Exchange
2023", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes SPAKE2, which is a protocol for two parties that share a password to derive a strong shared key without disclosing the password.  This method is compatible with any group, is computationally efficient, and has a security proof.  This document predated the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) competition, and it was not selected; however, given existing use of variants in Kerberos and other applications, it was felt that publication was beneficial.  Applications that need a symmetric PAKE, but are unable to hash onto an elliptic curve at execution time, can use SPAKE2.
