The CA interprets using sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.  Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency, termed a provider in this document.  The provider also provides a video service that allows users to connect video devices to their service and subsequently to CAs and other sign language speakers.  It is desirable that the videophones used by the sign language speaker conform to a standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that direct video calls between sign language speakers work.  This document describes the interface between a videophone and a provider."];
