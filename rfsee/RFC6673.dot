Round-Trip Packet Loss Metrics

A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol

This memo specifies a Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP), based on the OWAMP, that adds two-way or round-trip measurement capabilities.  The TWAMP measurement architecture is usually comprised of two hosts with specific roles, and this allows for some protocol simplifications, making it an attractive alternative in some circumstances.

Packet Delay Variation Applicability
Statement

The metric definition in RFC 3393 has considerable flexibility, and it allows multiple formulations of delay variation through the specification of different packet selection functions. Although flexibility provides wide coverage and room for new ideas, it can make comparisons of independent implementations more difficult. Two different formulations of delay variation have come into wide use in the context of active measurements. This memo examines a range of circumstances for active measurements of delay variation and their uses, and recommends which of the two forms is best matched to particular conditions and tasks.

Network performance measurement with

2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3432.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo describes a periodic sampling method and relevant metrics for assessing the performance of IP networks.  First, the memo motivates periodic sampling and addresses the question of its value as an alternative to the Poisson sampling described in RFC 2330.  The benefits include applicability to active and passive measurements, simulation of constant bit rate (CBR) traffic (typical of multimedia communication, or nearly CBR, as found with voice activity detection), and several instances in which analysis can be simplified.  The sampling method avoids predictability by mandating random start times and finite length tests.  Following descriptions of the sampling method and sample metric parameters, measurement methods and errors are discussed.  Finally, we give additional information on periodic measurements, including security considerations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The memo first defines a reordered singleton, and then uses it as the basis for sample metrics to quantify the extent of reordering in several useful dimensions for network characterization or receiver design.  Additional metrics quantify the frequency of reordering and the distance between separate occurrences.  We then define a metric oriented toward assessment of reordering effects on TCP.  Several examples of evaluation using the various sample metrics are included.  An appendix gives extended definitions for evaluating order with packet fragmentation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Model-Based Metrics for Bulk Transport
Capacity
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8337.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document introduces a new class of Model-Based Metrics designed to assess if a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Target Transport Performance by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to successive subpaths. The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly applied to critical infrastructure, such as network interconnections or even individual devices, to accurately detect if any part of the infrastructure will prevent paths traversing it from meeting the Target Transport Performance. Model-Based Metrics rely on mathematical models to specify a Targeted IP Diagnostic Suite, a set of IP diagnostic tests designed to assess whether common transport protocols can be expected to meet a predetermined Target Transport Performance over an Internet path. For Bulk Transport Capacity, the IP diagnostics are built using test streams and statistical criteria for evaluating the packet transfer that mimic TCP over the complete path. The temporal structure of the test stream (e.g., bursts) mimics TCP or other transport protocols carrying bulk data over a long path. However, they are constructed to be independent of the details of the subpath under test, end systems, or applications. Likewise, the success criteria evaluates the packet transfer statistics of the subpath against criteria determined by protocol performance models applied to the Target Transport Performance of the complete path. The success criteria also does not depend on the details of the subpath, end systems, or applications."];
