Downgrading Mechanism for Email Address
Internationalization
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5504.html", target="_top", tooltip="Traditional mail systems handle only ASCII characters in SMTP envelope and mail header fields.  The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension allows UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail header fields.  To avoid rejecting internationalized email messages when a server in the delivery path does not support the UTF8SMTP extension, some sort of converting mechanism is required.  This document describes a downgrading mechanism for Email Address Internationalization.  Note that this is a way to downgrade, not tunnel.  There is no associated up-conversion mechanism, although internationalized email clients might use original internationalized addresses or other data when displaying or replying to downgraded messages.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Internet Mail Architecture

These changes have been evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve both its installed base and its usefulness.  To collaborate productively on this large and complex system, all participants need to work from a common view of it and use a common language to describe its components and the interactions among them.  But the many differences in perspective currently make it difficult to know exactly what another participant means.  To serve as the necessary common frame of reference, this document describes the enhanced Internet Mail architecture, reflecting the current service.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Post-Delivery Message Downgrading for
Internationalized Email Messages
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6857.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Email Address Internationalization (SMTPUTF8) extension to SMTP allows Unicode characters encoded in UTF-8 and outside the ASCII repertoire in mail header fields.  Upgraded POP and IMAP servers support internationalized messages.  If a POP or IMAP client does not support Email Address Internationalization, a POP or IMAP server cannot deliver internationalized messages to the client and cannot remove the message.  To avoid that situation, this document describes a mechanism for converting internationalized messages into the traditional message format.  As part of the conversion process, message elements that require internationalized treatment are recoded or removed, and receivers are able to recognize that they received messages containing such elements, even if they cannot process the internationalized elements."];

Header Protection for Cryptographically
Protected Email
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9788.html", target="_top", tooltip="S/MIME version 3.1 introduced a mechanism to provide end-to-end cryptographic protection of email message headers. However, few implementations generate messages using this mechanism, and several legacy implementations have revealed rendering or security issues when handling such a message. This document updates the S/MIME specification (RFC 8551) to offer a different mechanism that provides the same cryptographic protections but with fewer downsides when handled by legacy clients. Furthermore, it offers more explicit usability, privacy, and security guidance for clients when generating or handling email messages with cryptographic protection of message headers. The Header Protection scheme defined here is also applicable to messages with PGP/MIME (Pretty Good Privacy with MIME) cryptographic protections."];
