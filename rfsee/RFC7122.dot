UDP and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) are the candidate datagram protocols discussed.  UDP can only be used on a local network or in cases where the DTN node implements explicit congestion control.

Licklider Transmission Protocol -
Motivation
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5325.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the motivation for the development of the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) designed to provide retransmission-based reliability over links characterized by extremely long message round-trip times (RTTs) and/or frequent interruptions in connectivity. Since communication across interplanetary space is the most prominent example of this sort of environment, LTP is principally aimed at supporting long-haul reliable transmission in interplanetary space, but it has applications in other environments as well. In an Interplanetary Internet setting deploying the Bundle protocol, LTP is intended to serve as a reliable convergence layer over single-hop deep-space radio frequency (RF) links. LTP does Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) of data transmissions by soliciting selective-acknowledgment reception reports. It is stateful and has no negotiation or handshakes.

Unicast UDP Usage Guidelines for
