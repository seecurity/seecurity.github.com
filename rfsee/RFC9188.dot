  RFC9188 [label="RFC9188
Generic Multi-Access (GMA) Encapsulation
Protocol
2022", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="A device can be simultaneously connected to multiple networks, e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, and DSL.  It is desirable to seamlessly combine the connectivity over these networks below the transport layer (L4) to improve the quality of experience for applications that do not have built-in multi-path capabilities.  Such optimization requires additional control information, e.g., a sequence number, in each packet.  This document presents a new lightweight and flexible encapsulation protocol for this need.  The solution has been developed by the authors based on their experiences in multiple standards bodies including the IETF and 3GPP.  However, this document is not an Internet Standard and does not represent the consensus opinion of the IETF.  This document will enable other developers to build interoperable implementations in order to experiment with the protocol."];
