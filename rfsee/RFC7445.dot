IPv6 in 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) Evolved Packet System

Operators that have deployed networks based on 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network architectures are facing IPv4 address shortages at the Internet registries and are feeling pressure to migrate to IPv6.  This document describes the support for IPv6 in 3GPP network architectures.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Dual-Stack Hosts Using Bump-in-the-Host

The host on which applications are running may be connected to IPv6-only or dual-stack access networks.  BIH hides IPv6 and makes the IPv4-only applications think they are talking with IPv4 peers by local synthesis of IPv4 addresses.  This document obsoletes RFC 2767 and RFC 3338. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
