BGP Communities for Data Collection
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="BGP communities (RFC 1997) are used by service providers for many purposes, including tagging of customer, peer, and geographically originated routes.  Such tagging is typically used to control the scope of redistribution of routes within a provider's network and to its peers and customers.  With the advent of large-scale BGP data collection (and associated research), it has become clear that the information carried in such communities is essential for a deeper understanding of the global routing system.
