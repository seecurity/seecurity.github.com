Internet Small Computer Systems
Interface (iSCSI)

The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with the standardized SCSI architecture model.  SCSI is a popular family of protocols that enable systems to communicate with I/O devices, especially storage devices.  SCSI protocols are request/response application protocols with a common standardized architecture model and basic command set, as well as standardized command sets for different device classes (disks, tapes, media-changers etc.).  As system interconnects move from the classical bus structure to a network structure, SCSI has to be mapped to network transport protocols.  IP networks now meet the performance requirements of fast system interconnects and as such are good candidates to carry SCSI. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The size of the IV depends on the applied transform and is usually 8 or 16 octets for the transforms defined at the time this document was written.  When used with IPsec, some algorithms, such as AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and ChaCha20-Poly1305, take the IV to generate a nonce that is used as an input parameter for encrypting and decrypting.  This IV must be unique but can be predictable.  As a result, the value provided in the ESP Sequence Number (SN) can be used instead to generate the nonce.  This avoids sending the IV itself and saves 8 octets per packet in the case of AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and ChaCha20-Poly1305.  This document describes how to do this."];
