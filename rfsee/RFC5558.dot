Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration in IPv6

Use of the extension causes nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface identifiers that change over time, even in cases where the interface contains an embedded IEEE identifier.  Changing the interface identifier (and the global scope addresses generated from it) over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to identify when different addresses used in different transactions actually correspond to the same node.

As IPv4 address exhaustion approaches, IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues become more critical and less tractable.
