A SIP Event Package for Subscribing to

This document proposes a mechanism, based on the SIP Event Framework, for doing so. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Observing Resources in the Constrained

The state of a resource on a CoAP server can change over time.  This document specifies a simple protocol extension for CoAP that enables CoAP clients to observe resources, i.e., to retrieve a representation of a resource and keep this representation updated by the server over a period of time.  The protocol follows a best-effort approach for sending new representations to clients and provides eventual consistency between the state observed by each client and the actual resource state at the server."];
