Some Internet Architectural Guidelines
and Philosophy

We describe the Simplicity Principle, which states that complexity is the primary mechanism that impedes efficient scaling, and discuss its implications on the architecture, design and engineering issues found in large scale Internet backbones.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Guidelines for Extending the RTP Control
Protocol (RTCP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5968.html", target="_top", tooltip="The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used along with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to provide a control channel between media senders and receivers.  This allows constructing a feedback loop to enable application adaptation and monitoring, among other uses.  The basic reporting mechanisms offered by RTCP are generic, yet quite powerful and suffice to cover a range of uses.  This document provides guidelines on extending RTCP if those basic mechanisms prove insufficient.

A Framework for Defining Network
Complexity
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7980.html", target="_top", tooltip="Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet there is no generally accepted definition of the term. Complexity metrics exist in a wide range of research papers, but most of these address only a particular aspect of a network, for example, the complexity of a graph or software. While it may be impossible to define a metric for overall network complexity, there is a desire to better understand the complexity of a network as a whole, as deployed today to provide Internet services. This document provides a framework to guide research on the topic of network complexity as well as some practical examples for trade-offs in networking. This document summarizes the work of the IRTF's Network Complexity Research Group (NCRG) at the time of its closure. It does not present final results, but a snapshot of an ongoing activity, as a basis for future work."];
