With the L4S architecture, all Internet applications could (but do not have to) transition away from congestion control algorithms that cause substantial queuing delay and instead adopt a new class of congestion controls that can seek capacity with very little queuing. These are aided by a modified form of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) from the network. With this new architecture, applications can have both low latency and high throughput. The architecture primarily concerns incremental deployment. It defines mechanisms that allow the new class of L4S congestion controls to coexist with 'Classic' congestion controls in a shared network.

Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)
Reverse Search
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9536.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include query capabilities for finding the list of domains related to a set of entities matching a given search pattern.  Considering that an RDAP entity can be associated with any defined object class and other relationships between RDAP object classes exist, a reverse search can be applied to other use cases besides the classic domain-entity scenario.  This document describes an RDAP extension that allows servers to provide a reverse search feature based on the relationship defined in RDAP between an object class for search and any related object class.  The reverse search based on the domain-entity relationship is treated as a particular case."];

Requirements for Solutions that Support
MPLS Network Actions (MNAs)

These requirements are informed by a number of proposals for additions to the MPLS information in the labeled packet to allow such actions to be performed, either by a transit or terminating Label Switching Router (i.e., the Label Edge Router - LER)."];

Partitioning as an Architecture for

This document describes emerging patterns in protocols to partition what data and metadata is revealed through protocol interactions, provides common terminology, and discusses how to analyze such models."];

State of Affairs for Randomized and
Changing Media Access Control (MAC)
Addresses
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9724.html", target="_top", tooltip="Internet users are becoming more aware that their activity over the Internet leaves a vast digital footprint, that communications might not always be properly secured, and that their location and actions can be tracked. One of the main factors that eases tracking of Internet users is the wide use of long-lasting, and sometimes persistent, identifiers at various protocol layers. This document focuses on Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. There have been several initiatives within the IETF and the IEEE 802 standards committees to address some of the privacy issues involved. This document provides an overview of these activities to help coordinate standardization activities in these bodies."];
