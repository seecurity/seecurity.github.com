This memo fixes errors introduced when the MIB module was converted to use the SMIv2 language. This memo also updates references to the current SNMP framework documents. This memo is intended to document deployed implementations of this MIB module in a historical context, to provide clarifications of some items, and to note errors where the MIB module fails to fully represent the BGP protocol. Work is currently in progress to replace this MIB module with a new one representing the current state of the BGP protocol and its extensions. This document obsoletes RFC 1269 and RFC 1657.
