IPv6 Next Hop
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8950.html", target="_top", tooltip="Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of usable next-hop address families is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI). The AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for advertising a next-hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or VPN-IPv4 NLRI. This document specifies the extensions necessary to allow the advertising of IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a next-hop address that belongs to the IPv6 protocol. This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address of the next hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the next hop to determine which of the protocols the address actually belongs to, and a BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP peers to dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 next hop. This document obsoletes RFC 5549."];

Interconnect Solution for Ethernet VPN
(EVPN) Overlay Networks
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9014.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes how Network Virtualization Overlays (NVOs) can be connected to a Wide Area Network (WAN) in order to extend the Layer 2 connectivity required for some tenants.  The solution analyzes the interaction between NVO networks running Ethernet Virtual Private Networks (EVPNs) and other Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) technologies used in the WAN, such as Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLSs), VPLS extensions for Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB-VPLS), EVPN, or PBB-EVPN.  It also describes how the existing technical specifications apply to the interconnection and extends the EVPN procedures needed in some cases.  In particular, this document describes how EVPN routes are processed on Gateways (GWs) that interconnect EVPN-Overlay and EVPN-MPLS networks, as well as the Interconnect Ethernet Segment (I-ES), to provide multihoming.  This document also describes the use of the Unknown MAC Route (UMR) to avoid issues of a Media Access Control (MAC) scale on Data Center Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) devices."];

A YANG Network Data Model for Layer 2
VPNs
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9291.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines an L2VPN Network Model (L2NM) that can be used to manage the provisioning of Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN) services within a network (e.g., a service provider network). The L2NM complements the L2VPN Service Model (L2SM) by providing a network-centric view of the service that is internal to a service provider. The L2NM is particularly meant to be used by a network controller to derive the configuration information that will be sent to relevant network devices. Also, this document defines a YANG module to manage Ethernet segments and the initial versions of two IANA-maintained modules that include a set of identities of BGP Layer 2 encapsulation types and pseudowire types."];
