QSPEC Template for the Quality-of-

(NSLP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5975.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Quality-of-Service (QoS) NSIS signaling layer protocol (NSLP) is used to signal QoS reservations and is independent of a specific QoS model (QOSM) such as IntServ or Diffserv.  Rather, all information specific to a QOSM is encapsulated in a separate object, the QSPEC.  This document defines a template for the QSPEC including a number of QSPEC parameters.  The QSPEC parameters provide a common language to be reused in several QOSMs and thereby aim to ensure the extensibility and interoperability of QoS NSLP.  While the base protocol is QOSM-agnostic, the parameters that can be carried in the QSPEC object are possibly closely coupled to specific models.  The node initiating the NSIS signaling adds an Initiator QSPEC, which indicates the QSPEC parameters that must be interpreted by the downstream nodes less the reservation fails, thereby ensuring the intention of the NSIS initiator is preserved along the signaling path.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

NSIS Operation over IP Tunnels
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5979.html", target="_top", tooltip="NSIS Quality of Service (QoS) signaling enables applications to perform QoS reservation along a data flow path.  When the data flow path contains IP tunnel segments, NSIS QoS signaling has no effect within those tunnel segments.  Therefore, the resulting tunnel segments could become the weakest QoS link and invalidate the QoS efforts in the rest of the end-to-end path.  The problem with NSIS signaling within the tunnel is caused by the tunnel encapsulation that masks packets' original IP header fields.  Those original IP header fields are needed to intercept NSIS signaling messages and classify QoS data packets.  This document defines a solution to this problem by mapping end-to-end QoS session requests to corresponding QoS sessions in the tunnel, thus extending the end-to-end QoS signaling into the IP tunnel segments.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Separation of Control and User Plane for

Existing specifications allow a mobile access gateway (MAG) to separate its control and user plane using the Alternate Care-of Address mobility option for IPv6 or Alternate IPv4 Care-of Address option for IPv4.  However, the current specification does not provide any mechanism allowing the local mobility anchor (LMA) to perform an analogous functional split.  To remedy that shortcoming, this document specifies a mobility option enabling an LMA to provide an alternate LMA address to be used for the bidirectional user-plane traffic between the MAG and LMA.  With this new option, an LMA will be able to use an IP address for its user plane that is different than the IP address used for the control plane."];

A YANG Data Model for Tunnel Interface

The module reflects the tunnelType registry maintained by IANA. The latest revision of this YANG module can be obtained from the IANA website. Tunnel type values are not directly added to the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module; they must instead be added to the tunnelType IANA registry. Once a new tunnel type registration is made by IANA for a new tunneling scheme or even an existing one that is not already listed in the current registry (e.g., LISP, NSH), IANA will update the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module accordingly. Some of the IETF-defined tunneling techniques are not listed in the current IANA registry.
