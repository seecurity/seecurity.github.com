PathErr Message Triggered MPLS and GMPLS
LSP Reroutes
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5710.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes how Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) PathErr messages may be used to trigger rerouting of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) point-to-point Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) without first removing LSP state or resources.  Such LSP rerouting may be desirable in a number of cases, including, for example, soft-preemption and graceful shutdown.  This document describes the usage of existing Standards Track mechanisms to support LSP rerouting.  In this case, it relies on mechanisms already defined as part of RSVP-TE and simply describes a sequence of actions to be executed.  While existing protocol definitions can be used to support reroute applications, this document also defines a new reroute-specific error code to allow for the future definition of reroute-application-specific error values.

MPLS Traffic Engineering Soft Preemption
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5712.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Soft Preemption, a suite of protocol modifications extending the concept of preemption with the goal of reducing or eliminating traffic disruption of preempted Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  Initially, MPLS RSVP-TE was defined with support for only immediate TE LSP displacement upon preemption.  The utilization of a reroute request notification helps more gracefully mitigate the reroute process of preempted TE LSP.  For the brief period soft preemption is activated, reservations (though not necessarily traffic levels) are in effect under-provisioned until the TE LSP(s) can be rerouted.  For this reason, the feature is primarily, but not exclusively, interesting in MPLS-enabled IP networks with Differentiated Services and Traffic Engineering capabilities. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
