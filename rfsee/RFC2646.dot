In the presence of these parameters, trailing whitespace is used to indicate flowed lines and a canonical quote indicator is used to indicate quoted lines.

This document supersedes the one specified in RFC 2646, The Text/Plain Format Parameter, and adds the DelSp parameter to accommodate languages/coded character sets in which ASCII spaces are not used or appear rarely.
