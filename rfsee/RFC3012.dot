Mobile IPv4 Challenge/Response
Extensions (Revised)

Unfortunately, that extension does not provide the foreign agent any direct guarantee that the protocol is protected from replays and does not allow for the use of existing techniques (such as Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)) for authenticating portable computer devices. In this specification, we define extensions for the Mobile IP Agent Advertisements and the Registration Request that allow a foreign agent to use a challenge/response mechanism to authenticate the mobile node. Furthermore, this document updates RFC 3344 by including a new authentication extension called the Mobile-Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Authentication extension. This new extension is provided so that a mobile node can supply credentials for authorization, using commonly available AAA infrastructure elements. This authorization-enabling extension MAY co-exist in the same Registration Request with authentication extensions defined for Mobile IP Registration by RFC 3344. This document obsoletes RFC 3012.

Protocol for Carrying Authentication for
Network Access (PANA) Requirements
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4058.html", target="_top", tooltip="It is expected that future IP devices will have a variety of access technologies to gain network connectivity.  Currently there are access-specific mechanisms for providing client information to the network for authentication and authorization purposes.  In addition to being limited to specific access media (e.g., 802.1X for IEEE 802 links), some of these protocols are limited to specific network topologies (e.g., PPP for point-to-point links).  The goal of this document is to identify the requirements for a link-layer agnostic protocol that allows a host and a network to authenticate each other for network access.  This protocol will run between a client's device and an agent in the network where the agent might be a client of the AAA infrastructure.

Cisco's Mobile IPv4 Host Configuration
Extensions
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4332.html", target="_top", tooltip="An IP device requires basic host configuration to be able to communicate.  For example, it will typically require an IP address and the address of a DNS server.  This information is configured statically or obtained dynamically using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or Point-to-Point Protocol/IP Control Protocol (PPP/IPCP).  However, both DHCP and PPP/IPCP provide host configuration based on the access network.  In Mobile IPv4, the registration process boots up a Mobile Node at an access network, also known as a foreign network.  The information to configure the host needs to be based on the home network.  This document describes the Cisco vendor-specific extensions to Mobile IPv4 to provide the base host configuration in Registration Request and Reply messages.

Mobile IPv4 Regional Registration
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4857.html", target="_top", tooltip="Using Mobile IP, a mobile node registers with its home agent each time it changes care-of address.  This document describes a new kind of regional registrations, i.e., registrations local to the visited domain.  The regional registrations are performed via a new network entity called a Gateway Foreign Agent (GFA) and introduce a layer of hierarchy in the visited domain.  Regional registrations reduce the number of signaling messages to the home network, and reduce the signaling delay when a mobile node moves from one foreign agent to another within the same visited domain.  This document is an optional extension to the Mobile IPv4 protocol.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];
