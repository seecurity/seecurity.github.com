Addressing an Amplification
Vulnerability in Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to address a security vulnerability identified in SIP proxy behavior. This vulnerability enables an attack against SIP networks where a small number of legitimate, even authorized, SIP requests can stimulate massive amounts of proxy-to-proxy traffic. This document strengthens loop-detection requirements on SIP proxies when they fork requests (that is, forward a request to more than one destination). It also corrects and clarifies the description of the loop-detection algorithm such proxies are required to implement. Additionally, this document defines a Max-Breadth mechanism for limiting the number of concurrent branches pursued for any given request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Stream Control Transmission Protocol

SCTP is designed to transport Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks, but is capable of broader applications. SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet network such as IP. It offers the following services to its users: -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data, -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size, -- sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages, -- optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association. The design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Terminology for Benchmarking Session

Methodology related to benchmarking SIP devices is described in the companion methodology document (RFC 7502).  Using these two documents, benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different types of devices such as SIP Proxy Servers, Registrars, and Session Border Controllers.  The term performance in this context means the capacity of the Device Under Test (DUT) to process SIP messages.  Media streams are used only to study how they impact the signaling behavior.  The intent of the two documents is to provide a normalized set of tests that will enable an objective comparison of the capacity of SIP devices.  Test setup parameters and a methodology are necessary because SIP allows a wide range of configurations and operational conditions that can influence performance benchmark measurements.  A standard terminology and methodology will ensure that benchmarks have consistent definitions and were obtained following the same procedures."];

The CA interprets using sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.  Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency, termed a provider in this document.  The provider also provides a video service that allows users to connect video devices to their service and subsequently to CAs and other sign language speakers.  It is desirable that the videophones used by the sign language speaker conform to a standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that direct video calls between sign language speakers work.  This document describes the interface between a videophone and a provider."];
