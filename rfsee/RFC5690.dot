Adding Acknowledgement Congestion
Control to TCP
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a possible congestion control mechanism for acknowledgement (ACKs) traffic in TCP.  The document specifies an end-to-end acknowledgement congestion control mechanism for TCP that uses participation from both TCP hosts: the TCP data sender and the TCP data receiver.  The TCP data sender detects lost or Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)-marked ACK packets, and tells the TCP data receiver the ACK Ratio R to use to respond to the congestion on the reverse path from the data receiver to the data sender.  The TCP data receiver sends roughly one ACK packet for every R data packets received.  This mechanism is based on the acknowledgement congestion control in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol's (DCCP's) Congestion Control Identifier (CCID) 2.  This acknowledgement congestion control mechanism is being specified for further evaluation by the network community.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Improving the Robustness of TCP to Non-
Congestion Events
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4653.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Non-Congestion Robustness (NCR) for TCP.  In the absence of explicit congestion notification from the network, TCP uses loss as an indication of congestion.  One of the ways TCP detects loss is using the arrival of three duplicate acknowledgments.  However, this heuristic is not always correct, notably in the case when network paths reorder segments (for whatever reason), resulting in degraded performance.  TCP-NCR is designed to mitigate this degraded performance by increasing the number of duplicate acknowledgments required to trigger loss recovery, based on the current state of the connection, in an effort to better disambiguate true segment loss from segment reordering.  This document specifies the changes to TCP, as well as the costs and benefits of these modifications.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

TCP Performance Implications of Network
Path Asymmetry
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3449.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes TCP performance problems that arise because of asymmetric effects.  These problems arise in several access networks, including bandwidth-asymmetric networks and packet radio subnetworks, for different underlying reasons.  However, the end result on TCP performance is the same in both cases: performance often degrades significantly because of imperfection and variability in the ACK feedback from the receiver to the sender.  The document details several mitigations to these effects, which have either been proposed or evaluated in the literature, or are currently deployed in networks.  These solutions use a combination of local link- layer techniques, subnetwork, and end-to-end mechanisms, consisting of: (i) techniques to manage the channel used for the upstream bottleneck link carrying the ACKs, typically using header compression or reducing the frequency of TCP ACKs, (ii) techniques to handle this reduced ACK frequency to retain the TCP sender's acknowledgment-triggered self- clocking and (iii) techniques to schedule the data and ACK packets in the reverse direction to improve performance in the presence of two-way traffic.  Each technique is described, together with known issues, and recommendations for use.  A summary of the recommendations is provided at the end of the document.

We give three strong recommendations: (1) packet size should be taken into account when transports detect and respond to congestion indications, (2) packet size should not be taken into account when network equipment creates congestion signals (marking, dropping), and therefore (3) in the specific case of RED, the byte- mode packet drop variant that drops fewer small packets should not be used.

Problem Statement and Requirements for

Congestion Notification (ECN) Feedback

An ECN-capable receiver will feed this information back to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that it can only feed back one congestion signal per Round-Trip Time (RTT).  In contrast, ECN for other transport protocols, such as RTP/UDP and SCTP, is specified with more accurate ECN feedback.  Recent new TCP mechanisms (like Congestion Exposure (ConEx) or Data Center TCP (DCTCP)) need more accurate ECN feedback in the case where more than one marking is received in one RTT.
