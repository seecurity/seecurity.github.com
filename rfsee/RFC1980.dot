Image maps are document elements which allow clicking different areas of an image to reference different network resources, as specified by Uniform Identifier (URIs).  The image map capability in HTML/2.0 is limited in several ways, such as the restriction that it only works with documents served via the HTTP protocol, and the lack of a viable fallback for users of text-only browsers.  This document specifies an extension to the HTML language, referred to as Client- Side Image Maps, which resolves these limitations.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
