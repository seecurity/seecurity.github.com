provisioned over the links that connect customer termination points
and a provider network. The required setup to allow successful data
exchange over these links is referred to as an attachment circuit
(AC), while the underlying link is referred to as a bearer. This document specifies a YANG service data model for ACs. This model
can be used for the provisioning of ACs before or during service
provisioning (e.g., RFC 9543 Network Slice Service). The document also specifies a YANG service data model for managing
bearers over which ACs are established."];
