Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse
Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification
(Revised)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4601.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM). PIM-SM is a multicast routing protocol that can use the underlying unicast routing information base or a separate multicast-capable routing information base. It builds unidirectional shared trees rooted at a Rendezvous Point (RP) per group, and optionally creates shortest-path trees per source. This document obsoletes RFC 2362, an Experimental version of PIM-SM. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

For IP version 6 (IPv6), the address prefix FF3x::/32 is reserved for source-specific multicast use.

Bidirectional Protocol Independent
Multicast (BIDIR-PIM)
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5015.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses Bidirectional PIM (BIDIR-PIM), a variant of PIM Sparse-Mode that builds bidirectional shared trees connecting multicast sources and receivers.  Bidirectional trees are built using a fail-safe Designated Forwarder (DF) election mechanism operating on each link of a multicast topology.  With the assistance of the DF, multicast data is natively forwarded from sources to the Rendezvous-Point (RP) and hence along the shared tree to receivers without requiring source-specific state.  The DF election takes place at RP discovery time and provides the route to the RP, thus eliminating the requirement for data-driven protocol events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
Join Attribute Format
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5384.html", target="_top", tooltip="A Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode Join message sent by a given node identifies one or more multicast distribution trees that that node wishes to join.  Each tree is identified by the combination of a multicast group address and a source address (where the source address is possibly a wild card).  Under certain conditions it can be useful, when joining a tree, to specify additional information related to the construction of the tree.  However, there has been no way to do so until now.  This document describes a modification of the Join message that allows a node to associate attributes with a particular tree.  The attributes are encoded in Type-Length-Value format.

Softwire Mesh Framework
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5565.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet needs to be able to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  However, it is expected that some constituent networks of the Internet will be single-protocol networks.  One kind of single-protocol network can parse only IPv4 packets and can process only IPv4 routing information; another kind can parse only IPv6 packets and can process only IPv6 routing information.  It is nevertheless required that either kind of single-protocol network be able to provide transit service for the other protocol.  This is done by passing the other kind of routing information from one edge of the single-protocol network to the other, and by tunneling the other kind of data packet from one edge to the other.  The tunnels are known as softwires.  This framework document explains how the routing information and the data packets of one protocol are passed through a single-protocol network of the other protocol.  The document is careful to specify when this can be done with existing technology and when it requires the development of new or modified technology. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
