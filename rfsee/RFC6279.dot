Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) Localized
Routing Problem Statement
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Proxy Mobile IPv6 is the IETF Standard for network-based mobility management.  In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes are topologically anchored at a Local Mobility Anchor, which forwards all data for registered mobile nodes.  The setup and maintenance of localized routing, which allows forwarding of data packets between two mobile nodes' Mobility Access Gateways without involvement of their Local Mobility Anchor in forwarding, is not considered.  This document describes the problem space of localized routing in Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Mobility Support in IPv6
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3775.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a protocol which allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Localized Routing for Proxy Mobile IPv6

PMIPv6 requires all communications to go through the local mobility anchor.  As this can be suboptimal, Localized Routing (LR) allows Mobile Nodes (MNs) attached to the same or different Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs) to route traffic by using localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways.  This document proposes initiation, utilization, and termination mechanisms for localized routing between mobile access gateways within a proxy mobile IPv6 domain.  It defines two new signaling messages, Localized Routing Initiation (LRI) and Local Routing Acknowledgment (LRA), that are used to realize this mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Localized Routing

The term localized routing refers to a method by which packets are routed directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node (CN) without involving any LMA.  In a Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment, it may be desirable to control the establishment of localized routing sessions between two MAGs in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain by requiring that the session be authorized.  This document specifies how to accomplish this using the Diameter protocol."];
