An Offer/Answer Model with Session

In the model, one participant offers the other a description of the desired session from their perspective, and the other participant answers with the desired session from their perspective.  This offer/answer model is most useful in unicast sessions where information from both participants is needed for the complete view of the session.  The offer/answer model is used by protocols like the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Happy Eyeballs: Success with Dual-Stack
Hosts

This is undesirable because it causes the dual- stack client to have a worse user experience.  This document specifies requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and provides an algorithm. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
