XML-Signature XPath Filter 2.0
2003", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="XML Signature recommends a standard means for specifying information content to be digitally signed and for representing the resulting digital signatures in XML.  Some applications require the ability to specify a subset of a given XML document as the information content to be signed.  The XML Signature specification meets this requirement with the XPath transform.  However, this transform can be difficult to implement efficiently with existing technologies.  This specification defines a new XML Signature transform to facilitate the development of efficient document subsetting implementations that interoperate under similar performance profiles.  This document is the W3C XML Signature XPath-Filter 2.0 Recommendation.  This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and other interested parties and has been endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation.  It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative reference from another document.  W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment.  This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
