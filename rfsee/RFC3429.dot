Uncoordinated Protocol Development
Considered Harmful
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5704.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document identifies problems that may result from the absence of formal coordination and joint development on protocols of mutual interest between standards development organizations (SDOs). Some of these problems may cause significant harm to the Internet. The document suggests that a robust procedure is required prevent this from occurring in the future. The IAB has selected a number of case studies, such as Transport MPLS (T-MPLS), as recent examples to describe the hazard to the Internet architecture that results from uncoordinated adaptation of a protocol. This experience has resulted in a considerable improvement in the relationship between the IETF and the ITU-T. In particular, this was achieved via the establishment of the Joint working team on MPLS-TP. In addition, the leadership of the two organizations agreed to improve inter-organizational working practices so as to avoid conflict in the future between ITU-T Recommendations and IETF RFCs. Whilst we use ITU-T - IETF interactions in these case studies, the scope of the document extends to all SDOs that have an overlapping protocol interest with the IETF.

Guidelines for the Use of the OAM

Looking at the acronym a bit more closely reveals a set of recurring problems that are revisited time and again.

There are other definitions and acronyms that will be discussed while exploring the definition of the constituent parts of the OAM term. This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice."];

Allocating and Retiring Special-Purpose
MPLS Labels
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7274.html", target="_top", tooltip="Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes. A block of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end; these labels are commonly called reserved labels. They will be called special-purpose labels in this document. As there are only 16 of these special-purpose labels, caution is needed in the allocation of new special-purpose labels; yet, at the same time, forward progress should be allowed when one is called for. This memo defines new procedures for the allocation and retirement of special-purpose labels, as well as a method to extend the special-purpose label space and a description of how to handle extended special-purpose labels in the data plane. Finally, this memo renames the IANA registry for special-purpose labels to Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values and creates a new registry called the Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values registry. This document updates a number of previous RFCs that use the term reserved label. Specifically, this document updates RFCs 3032, 3038, 3209, 3811, 4182, 4928, 5331, 5586, 5921, 5960, 6391, 6478, and 6790."];
