IP Tunnel MIB

In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing tunnels of any type over IPv4 and IPv6 networks.  Extension MIB modules may be designed for managing protocol-specific objects.  Likewise, extension MIB modules may be designed for managing security-specific objects.  This MIB module does not support tunnels over non-IP networks.  Management of such tunnels may be supported by other MIB modules.  This memo obsoletes RFC 2667. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A YANG Data Model for Tunnel Interface
Types
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8675.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies the initial version of a YANG module iana-tunnel-type, which contains a collection of IANA-maintained YANG identities used as interface types for tunnel interfaces. The module reflects the tunnelType registry maintained by IANA. The latest revision of this YANG module can be obtained from the IANA website. Tunnel type values are not directly added to the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module; they must instead be added to the tunnelType IANA registry. Once a new tunnel type registration is made by IANA for a new tunneling scheme or even an existing one that is not already listed in the current registry (e.g., LISP, NSH), IANA will update the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module accordingly. Some of the IETF-defined tunneling techniques are not listed in the current IANA registry. It is not the intent of this document to update the existing IANA registry with a comprehensive list of tunnel technologies. Registrants must follow the IETF registration procedure for interface types whenever a new tunnel type is needed."];
