The Internet Routing Overlay Network
(IRON)
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6179.html", target="_top", tooltip="Since the Internet must continue to support escalating growth due to increasing demand, it is clear that current routing architectures and operational practices must be updated.  This document proposes an Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) that supports sustainable growth while requiring no changes to end systems and no changes to the existing routing system.  IRON further addresses other important issues including routing scaling, mobility management, multihoming, traffic engineering and NAT traversal.  While business considerations are an important determining factor for widespread adoption, they are out of scope for this document.  This document is a product of the IRTF Routing Research Group.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];
