It offers the following services to its users: -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data, -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size, -- sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages, -- optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association.

Applications requiring this feature want it so that they can reuse streams for different purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number so that the application can track the message flows.  Thus, without this feature, a new use of an old stream would result in message numbers greater than expected, unless there is a protocol mechanism to reset the streams back to zero.  This document also includes methods for resetting the transmission sequence numbers, adding additional streams, and resetting all stream sequence numbers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
