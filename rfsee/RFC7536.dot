Large-Scale Broadband Measurement Use
Cases
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for network diagnostics by providers and users, as well as for public policy.  Understanding the various scenarios and users of measuring broadband performance is essential to development of the Large-scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) framework, information model, and protocol.  This document details two use cases that can assist in developing that framework.  The details of the measurement metrics themselves are beyond the scope of this document."];
