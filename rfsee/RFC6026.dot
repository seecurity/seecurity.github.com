Correct Transaction Handling for 2xx
Responses to Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) INVITE Requests
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to address an error in the specified handling of success (2xx class) responses to INVITE requests.  Elements following RFC 3261 exactly will misidentify retransmissions of the request as a new, unassociated request.  The correction involves modifying the INVITE transaction state machines.  The correction also changes the way responses that cannot be matched to an existing transaction are handled to address a security risk.

Terminology for Benchmarking Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) Devices: Basic
Session Setup and Registration
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7501.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides a terminology for benchmarking the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance of devices.  Methodology related to benchmarking SIP devices is described in the companion methodology document (RFC 7502).  Using these two documents, benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different types of devices such as SIP Proxy Servers, Registrars, and Session Border Controllers.  The term performance in this context means the capacity of the Device Under Test (DUT) to process SIP messages.  Media streams are used only to study how they impact the signaling behavior.  The intent of the two documents is to provide a normalized set of tests that will enable an objective comparison of the capacity of SIP devices.  Test setup parameters and a methodology are necessary because SIP allows a wide range of configurations and operational conditions that can influence performance benchmark measurements.  A standard terminology and methodology will ensure that benchmarks have consistent definitions and were obtained following the same procedures."];
