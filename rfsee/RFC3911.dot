Session Initiation Protocol Service
Examples
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5359.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document gives examples of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) services.  This covers most features offered in so-called IP Centrex offerings from local exchange carriers and PBX (Private Branch Exchange) features.  Most of the services shown in this document are implemented in the SIP user agents, although some require the assistance of a SIP proxy.  Some require some extensions to SIP including the REFER, SUBSCRIBE, and NOTIFY methods and the Replaces and Join header fields.  These features are not intended to be an exhaustive set, but rather show implementations of common features likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones in a business environment.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];

A Call Control and Multi-Party Usage
Framework for the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5850.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a framework and the requirements for call control and multi-party usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  To enable discussion of multi-party features and applications, we define an abstract call model for describing the media relationships required by many of these.  The model and actions described here are specifically chosen to be independent of the SIP signaling and/or mixing approach chosen to actually set up the media relationships.  In addition to its dialog manipulation aspect, this framework includes requirements for communicating related information and events such as conference and session state and session history.  This framework also describes other goals that embody the spirit of SIP applications as used on the Internet such as the definition of primitives (not services), invoker and participant oriented primitives, signaling and mixing model independence, and others.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

SIP-Specific Event Notification

The purpose of this extension is to provide an extensible framework by which SIP nodes can request notification from remote nodes indicating that certain events have occurred. Note that the event notification mechanisms defined herein are NOT intended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for all classes of event subscription and notification. This document represents a backwards-compatible improvement on the original mechanism described by RFC 3265, taking into account several years of implementation experience. Accordingly, this document obsoletes RFC 3265. This document also updates RFC 4660 slightly to accommodate some small changes to the mechanism that were discussed in that document.

Shared Appearances of a Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) Address of

When implemented using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), it is referred to as shared appearances of an Address of Record (AOR) since SIP does not have the concept of lines.  This feature is commonly offered in IP Centrex services and IP Private Branch Exchange (IPBX) offerings and is likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones and SIP feature servers used in a business environment.  This feature allows several user agents (UAs) to share a common AOR, learn about calls placed and received by other UAs in the group, and pick up or join calls within the group.  This document discusses use cases, lists requirements, and defines extensions to implement this feature.  This specification updates RFCs 3261 and 4235."];

Marking SIP Messages to Be Logged
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8497.html", target="_top", tooltip="SIP networks use signaling monitoring tools to diagnose user-reported problems and to perform regression testing if network or user agent (UA) software is upgraded. As networks grow and become interconnected, including connection via transit networks, it becomes impractical to predict the path that SIP signaling will take between user agents and therefore impractical to monitor SIP signaling end to end. This document describes an indicator for the SIP protocol that can be used to mark signaling as being of interest to logging. Such marking will typically be applied as part of network testing controlled by the network operator and is not used in normal user agent signaling. Operators of all networks on the signaling path can agree to carry such marking end to end, including the originating and terminating SIP user agents, even if a session originates and terminates in different networks."];
