PIM Group-to-Rendezvous-Point Mapping
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Each Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) router in a PIM domain that supports Any Source Multicast (ASM) maintains Group-to-RP mappings that are used to identify a Rendezvous Point (RP) for a specific multicast group. PIM-SM has defined an algorithm to choose a RP from the Group-to-RP mappings learned using various mechanisms. This algorithm does not consider the PIM mode and the mechanism through which a Group-to-RP mapping was learned. This document defines a standard algorithm to deterministically choose between several Group-to-RP mappings for a specific group. This document first explains the requirements to extend the Group-to-RP mapping algorithm and then proposes the new algorithm. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Bidirectional trees are built using a fail-safe Designated Forwarder (DF) election mechanism operating on each link of a multicast topology.  With the assistance of the DF, multicast data is natively forwarded from sources to the Rendezvous-Point (RP) and hence along the shared tree to receivers without requiring source-specific state.  The DF election takes place at RP discovery time and provides the route to the RP, thus eliminating the requirement for data-driven protocol events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
