This memo defines a simple protocol by which management information for a network element may be inspected or altered by logically remote users.  In particular, together with its companion memos which describe the structure of management information along with the initial management information base, these documents provide a simple, workable architecture and system for managing TCP/IP-based internets and in particular the Internet."];

Common Management Information Services

This architecture provides a means by which control and monitoring information can be exchanged between a manager and a remote network element.  In particular, this memo defines the means for implementing the Draft International Standard (DIS) version of CMIS/CMIP on top of Internet transport protocols for the purpose of carrying management information defined in the Internet-standard management information base.  DIS CMIS/CMIP is suitable for deployment in TCP/IP networks while CMIS/CMIP moves toward becoming an International Standard.  Together with the relevant ISO standards and the companion RFCs that describe the initial structure of management information and management information base, these documents provide the basis for a comprehensive architecture and system for managing TCP/IP- based internets, and in particular the Internet."];

Independent Submissions to the RFC

These documents, known as Independent Submissions, serve a number of important functions for the Internet community, both inside and outside of the community of active IETF participants.  This document discusses the Independent Submission model and some reasons why it is important.  It then describes editorial and processing norms that can be used for Independent Submissions as the community goes forward into new relationships between the IETF community and its primary technical publisher.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
