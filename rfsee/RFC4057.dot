IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the scenarios for IPv6 deployment within enterprise networks.  It defines a small set of basic enterprise scenarios and includes pertinent questions to allow enterprise administrators to further refine their deployment scenarios.  Enterprise deployment requirements are discussed in terms of coexistence with IPv4 nodes, networks and applications, and in terms of basic network infrastructure requirements for IPv6 deployment.  The scenarios and requirements described in this document will be the basis for further analysis to determine what coexistence techniques and mechanisms are needed for enterprise IPv6 deployment.  The results of that analysis will be published in a separate document.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

IPv6 Tunnel Broker with the Tunnel Setup
Protocol (TSP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5572.html", target="_top", tooltip="A tunnel broker with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) enables the establishment of tunnels of various inner protocols, such as IPv6 or IPv4, inside various outer protocols packets, such as IPv4, IPv6, or UDP over IPv4 for IPv4 NAT traversal.  The control protocol (TSP) is used by the tunnel client to negotiate the tunnel with the broker.  A mobile node implementing TSP can be connected to both IPv4 and IPv6 networks whether it is on IPv4 only, IPv4 behind a NAT, or on IPv6 only.  A tunnel broker may terminate the tunnels on remote tunnel servers or on itself.  This document describes the TSP within the model of the tunnel broker model.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Routing and Addressing in Networks with

Guidelines for Using IPv6 Transition
Mechanisms during IPv6 Deployment
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6180.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet continues to grow beyond the capabilities of IPv4.  An expansion in the address space is clearly required.  With its increase in the number of available prefixes and addresses in a subnet, and improvements in address management, IPv6 is the only real option on the table.  Yet, IPv6 deployment requires some effort, resources, and expertise.  The availability of many different deployment models is one reason why expertise is required.  This document discusses the IPv6 deployment models and migration tools, and it recommends ones that have been found to work well in operational networks in many common situations.

The purpose of this document is, on the one hand, to help system developers and users to select appropriate standard management protocols and data models to address relevant management needs.  On the other hand, the document can be used as an overview and guideline by other Standard Development Organizations or bodies planning to use IETF management technologies and data models.  This document does not cover Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) technologies on the data-path, e.g., OAM of tunnels, MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) OAM, and pseudowire as well as the corresponding management models.

Operational Guidance for IPv6 Deployment
in IPv4 Sites Using the Intra-Site
Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol
(ISATAP)

These sites range in size from small home/office networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that IPv4 provides satisfactory internal routing and addressing services for most applications.  As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed, however, end-user devices within such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6 functionality.  This document therefore provides operational guidance for deployment of IPv6 within predominantly IPv4 sites using the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)."];

The administrators face different challenges than operators of Internet access providers and have reasons for different priorities.  The overall problem for many administrators will be to offer Internet- facing services over IPv6 while continuing to support IPv4, and while introducing IPv6 access within the enterprise IT network.  The overall transition will take most networks from an IPv4-only environment to a dual-stack network environment and eventually an IPv6-only operating mode.  This document helps provide a framework for enterprise network architects or administrators who may be faced with many of these challenges as they consider their IPv6 support strategies."];
