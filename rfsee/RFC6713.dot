SMTP TLS Reporting
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8460.html", target="_top", tooltip="A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels between SMTP Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs), including STARTTLS, DNS- Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) TLSA, and MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS).  These protocols can fail due to misconfiguration or active attack, leading to undelivered messages or delivery over unencrypted or unauthenticated channels.  This document describes a reporting mechanism and format by which sending systems can share statistics and specific information about potential failures with recipient domains.  Recipient domains can then use this information to both detect potential attacks and diagnose unintentional misconfigurations."];

Multicast Email (MULE) over Allied

This document defines MULE (Multicast Email), an application protocol for transferring Internet Mail messages (as described in RFC 5322) over P_MUL (as defined in ACP 142). MULE enables transfer between Message Transfer Agents (MTAs). It doesn't provide a service similar to SMTP Submission (as described in RFC 6409). This document explains how MULE can be used in conjunction with SMTP (RFC 5321), including some common SMTP extensions, to provide an alternate MTA-to-MTA transfer mechanism. This is not an IETF specification; it describes an existing implementation. It is provided in order to facilitate interoperable implementations and third-party diagnostics."];
