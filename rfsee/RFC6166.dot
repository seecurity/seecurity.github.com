A Registry for PIM Message Types

Bidirectional Protocol Independent

Bidirectional trees are built using a fail-safe Designated Forwarder (DF) election mechanism operating on each link of a multicast topology.  With the assistance of the DF, multicast data is natively forwarded from sources to the Rendezvous-Point (RP) and hence along the shared tree to receivers without requiring source-specific state.  The DF election takes place at RP discovery time and provides the route to the RP, thus eliminating the requirement for data-driven protocol events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.

Protocol Independent Multicast Equal-
Cost Multipath (ECMP) Redirect
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6754.html", target="_top", tooltip="A Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) router uses the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) procedure to select an upstream interface and router in order to build forwarding state.  When there are equal cost multipaths (ECMPs), existing implementations often use hash algorithms to select a path.  Such algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic among the ECMPs according to administrative metrics.  This usually leads to inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.  This document introduces the ECMP Redirect, a mechanism to improve the RPF procedure over ECMPs.  It allows ECMP selection to be based on administratively selected metrics, such as data transmission delays, path preferences, and routing metrics. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
