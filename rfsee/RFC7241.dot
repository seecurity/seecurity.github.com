Defining the Role and Function of IETF
Protocol Parameter Registry Operators
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6220.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols make use of commonly defined values that are passed in messages or packets.  To ensure consistent interpretation of these values between independent implementations, there is a need to ensure that the values and associated semantic intent are uniquely defined.  The IETF uses registry functions to record assigned protocol parameter values and their associated semantic intentions.  For each IETF protocol parameter, it is current practice for the IETF to delegate the role of Protocol Parameter Registry Operator to a nominated entity.  This document provides a description of, and the requirements for, these delegated functions.

On Consensus and Humming in the IETF
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7282.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through a consensus process, taking into account the different views among IETF participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on technical matters. In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run by a majority rule philosophy. This is why we engage in rituals like humming instead of voting. However, more and more of our actions are now indistinguishable from voting, and quite often we are letting the majority win the day without consideration of minority concerns. This document explains some features of rough consensus, what is not rough consensus, how we have gotten away from it, how we might think about it differently, and the things we can do in order to really achieve rough consensus. Note: This document is quite consciously being put forward as Informational. It does not propose to change any IETF processes and is therefore not a BCP. It is simply a collection of principles, hopefully around which the IETF can come to (at least rough) consensus."];

EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP.  EAP provides its own support for duplicate elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees.  Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual EAP methods may support this.  This document obsoletes RFC 2284.

This set of state machines shows how EAP can be implemented to support deployment in either a peer/authenticator or peer/authenticator/AAA Server environment. The peer and stand-alone authenticator machines are illustrative of how the EAP protocol defined in RFC 3748 may be implemented. The backend and full/pass-through authenticators illustrate how EAP/AAA protocol support defined in RFC 3579 may be implemented. Where there are differences, RFC 3748 and RFC 3579 are authoritative. The state machines are based on the EAP Switch model. This model includes events and actions for the interaction between the EAP Switch and EAP methods. A brief description of the EAP Switch model is given in the Introduction section. The state machine and associated model are informative only. Implementations may achieve the same results using different methods. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
