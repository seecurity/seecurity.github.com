ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for
Unicast Secure RTP
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6189.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines ZRTP, a protocol for media path Diffie-Hellman exchange to agree on a session key and parameters for establishing unicast Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) sessions for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.  The ZRTP protocol is media path keying because it is multiplexed on the same port as RTP and does not require support in the signaling protocol.  ZRTP does not assume a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or require the complexity of certificates in end devices.  For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication.  ZRTP can utilize a Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication through the signaling channel.  To provide best effort SRTP, ZRTP utilizes normal RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) profiles.  ZRTP secures media sessions that include a voice media stream and can also secure media sessions that do not include voice by using an optional digital signature.

Session PEERing for Multimedia
INTerconnect (SPEERMINT) Security
Threats and Suggested Countermeasures
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6404.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session PEERing for Multimedia INTerconnect (SPEERMINT) working group (WG) provides a peering framework that leverages the building blocks of existing IETF-defined protocols such as SIP and ENUM for the interconnection between SIP Service Providers (SSPs).  The objective of this document is to identify and enumerate SPEERMINT- specific threat vectors and to give guidance for implementers on selecting appropriate countermeasures.  Security requirements for SPEERMINT that have been derived from the threats detailed in this document can be found in RFC 6271; this document provides concrete countermeasures to meet those SPEERMINT security requirements.  In this document, the different security threats related to SPEERMINT are classified into threats to the Lookup Function (LUF), the Location Routing Function (LRF), the Signaling Function (SF), and the Media Function (MF) of a specific SIP Service Provider.  Various instances of the threats are briefly introduced inside the classification.  Finally, existing security solutions for SIP and RTP/RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol) are presented to describe countermeasures currently available for such threats.  Each SSP may have connections to one or more remote SSPs through peering or transit contracts.  A potentially compromised remote SSP that attacks other SSPs is out of the scope of this document; this document focuses on attacks on an SSP from outside the trust domain such an SSP may have with other SSPs.
