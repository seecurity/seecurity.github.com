Duplicate Address Detection Proxy
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6957.html", target="_top", tooltip="The document describes a proxy-based mechanism allowing the use of Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) by IPv6 nodes in a point-to-multipoint architecture with a split-horizon forwarding scheme, primarily deployed for Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and Fiber access architectures.  Based on the DAD signaling, the first-hop router stores in a Binding Table all known IPv6 addresses used on a point-to-multipoint domain (e.g., VLAN).  When a node performs DAD for an address already used by another node, the first-hop router defends the address rather than the device using the address."];

Neighbor Discovery Considerations in
IPv6 Deployments
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9898.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol is a critical component of the
IPv6 architecture. The protocol uses multicast in many messages. It
also assumes a security model where all nodes on a link are trusted.
Such a design might be inefficient in some scenarios (e.g., use of
multicast in wireless networks) or when nodes are not trustworthy
(e.g., public access networks). These security and operational issues
and the associated mitigation solutions are documented in more than
twenty RFCs. There is a need to track these issues and solutions in a
single document. To that aim, this document summarizes the published ND issues and
then describes how all these issues originate from three causes.
Addressing the issues is made simpler by addressing the causes. This
document also analyzes the mitigation solutions and demonstrates that
isolating hosts into different subnets and links can help to address
the three causes. Guidance is provided for selecting a suitable
isolation method to prevent potential ND issues."];
