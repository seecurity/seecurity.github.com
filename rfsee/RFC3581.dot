An Extension to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) for Symmetric Response
Routing
2003", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) operates over UDP and TCP, among others.  When used with UDP, responses to requests are returned to the source address the request came from, and to the port written into the topmost Via header field value of the request.  This behavior is not desirable in many cases, most notably, when the client is behind a Network Address Translator (NAT).  This extension defines a new parameter for the Via header field, called rport, that allows a client to request that the server send the response back to the source IP address and port from which the request originated.

Managing Client-Initiated Connections in
the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5626.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to initiate TCP connections or to send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User Agents in order to deliver requests.  However, in a large number of real deployments, many practical considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs) or the use of TLS with server-provided certificates, prevent servers from connecting to User Agents in this way.  This specification defines behaviors for User Agents, registrars, and proxy servers that allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent.  It also defines keep-alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple connections from the User Agent to its registrar. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
