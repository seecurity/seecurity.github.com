Location-to-Service Translation (LoST)

Currently, the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol only supports mapping locations to a single service based on service regions.

GEOPRIV Presence Information Data Format
Location Object (PIDF-LO) Usage
Clarification, Considerations, and
Recommendations
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5491.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) specification provides a flexible and versatile means to represent location information.  There are, however, circumstances that arise when information needs to be constrained in how it is represented.  In these circumstances, the range of options that need to be implemented are reduced.  There is growing interest in being able to use location information contained in a PIDF-LO for routing applications.  To allow successful interoperability between applications, location information needs to be normative and more tightly constrained than is currently specified in RFC 4119 (PIDF-LO).  This document makes recommendations on how to constrain, represent, and interpret locations in a PIDF-LO.  It further recommends a subset of Geography Markup Language (GML) 3.1.1 that is mandatory to implement by applications involved in location-based routing. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

This format is designed for use with Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) documents and replaces the civic location format in RFC 4119.  The format is based on the civic address definition in PIDF-LO, but adds several new elements based on the civic types defined for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and adds a hierarchy to address complex road identity schemes.  The format also includes support for the xml:lang language tag and restricts the types of elements where appropriate. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
