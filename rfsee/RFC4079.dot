A Presence Architecture for the
Distribution of GEOPRIV Location Objects
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="GEOPRIV defines the concept of a 'using protocol' -- a protocol that carries GEOPRIV location objects.  GEOPRIV also defines various scenarios for the distribution of location objects that require the concepts of subscriptions and asynchronous notifications.  This document examines some existing IETF work on the concept of presence, shows how presence architectures map onto GEOPRIV architectures, and moreover demonstrates that tools already developed for presence could be reused to simplify the standardization and implementation of GEOPRIV.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Geolocation Policy: A Document Format

Location Information
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6772.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines an authorization policy language for controlling access to location information. It extends the Common Policy authorization framework to provide location-specific access control. More specifically, this document defines condition elements specific to location information in order to restrict access to data based on the current location of the Target. Furthermore, this document defines two algorithms for reducing the granularity of returned location information. The first algorithm is defined for usage with civic location information, whereas the other one applies to geodetic location information. Both algorithms come with limitations. There are circumstances where the amount of location obfuscation provided is less than what is desired. These algorithms might not be appropriate for all application domains. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Specifying Civic Address Extensions in

A backward- compatible mechanism for adding civic address elements to the Geopriv civic address format is described.  A formal mechanism for handling unsupported extensions when translating between XML and DHCP civic address forms is defined for entities that need to perform this translation.  Initial extensions for some new elements are also defined.  The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol mechanism (defined in RFC 5222) that returns civic address element names used for validation of location information is clarified and is normatively updated to require a qualifying namespace identifier on each civic address element returned as part of the validation process.
