Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP): IPv4 and IPv6 Dual-Stack Issues
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="A node may have support for communications using IPv4 and/or IPv6 protocols.  Such a node may wish to obtain IPv4 and/or IPv6 configuration settings via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  The original version of DHCP (RFC 2131) designed for IPv4 has now been complemented by a new DHCPv6 (RFC 3315) for IPv6.  This document describes issues identified with dual IP version DHCP interactions, the most important aspect of which is how to handle potential problems in clients processing configuration information received from both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers.  The document makes a recommendation on the general strategy on how best to handle such issues and identifies future work to be undertaken.

IPv6 Unicast Address Assignment
Considerations
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5375.html", target="_top", tooltip="One fundamental aspect of any IP communications infrastructure is its addressing plan.  With its new address architecture and allocation policies, the introduction of IPv6 into a network means that network designers and operators need to reconsider their existing approaches to network addressing.  Lack of guidelines on handling this aspect of network design could slow down the deployment and integration of IPv6.  This document aims to provide the information and recommendations relevant to planning the addressing aspects of IPv6 deployments.  The document also provides IPv6 addressing case studies for both an enterprise and an ISP network.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
IPv6 (DHCPv6)
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8415.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6): an extensible mechanism for configuring nodes with network configuration parameters, IP addresses, and prefixes. Parameters can be provided statelessly, or in combination with stateful assignment of one or more IPv6 addresses and/or IPv6 prefixes. DHCPv6 can operate either in place of or in addition to stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC). This document updates the text from RFC 3315 (the original DHCPv6 specification) and incorporates prefix delegation (RFC 3633), stateless DHCPv6 (RFC 3736), an option to specify an upper bound for how long a client should wait before refreshing information (RFC 4242), a mechanism for throttling DHCPv6 clients when DHCPv6 service is not available (RFC 7083), and relay agent handling of unknown messages (RFC 7283). In addition, this document clarifies the interactions between models of operation (RFC 7550). As such, this document obsoletes RFC 3315, RFC 3633, RFC 3736, RFC 4242, RFC 7083, RFC 7283, and RFC 7550."];
