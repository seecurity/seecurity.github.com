A solution framework for supporting this service in MPLS networks is described in RFC 7387, A Framework for Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) Service over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Network.  This document discusses how those functional requirements can be met with a solution based on RFC 7432, BGP MPLS Based Ethernet VPN (EVPN), with some extensions and a description of how such a solution can offer a more efficient implementation of these functions than that of RFC 7796, Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) Support in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS).  This document makes use of the most significant bit of the Tunnel Type field (in the P-Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel attribute) governed by the IANA registry created by RFC 7385; hence, it updates RFC 7385 accordingly."];

To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed.
