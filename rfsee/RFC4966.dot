Default Address Selection for Internet
Protocol version 6 (IPv6)

The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior.  In dual stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses - depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice-versa.  All IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers, must implement default address selection as defined in this specification. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

This document provides an overview of deployment scenarios with the goal of helping to understand what types of additional tools the industry needs to assist in IPv4 and IPv6 co-existence and transition. This document was originally created as input to the Montreal co- existence interim meeting in October 2008, which led to the rechartering of the Behave and Softwire working groups to take on new IPv4 and IPv6 co-existence work. This document is published as a historical record of the thinking at the time, but hopefully will also help readers understand the rationale behind current IETF tools for co-existence and transition.

The China Education and Research Network
(CERNET) IVI Translation Design and
Deployment for the IPv4/IPv6 Coexistence
and Transition
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6219.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents the China Education and Research Network (CERNET)'s IVI translation design and deployment for the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence and transition. The IVI is a prefix-specific and stateless address mapping mechanism for an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet and the IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network scenarios. In the IVI design, subsets of the ISP's IPv4 addresses are embedded in the ISP's IPv6 addresses, and the hosts using these IPv6 addresses can therefore communicate with the global IPv6 Internet directly and can communicate with the global IPv4 Internet via stateless translators. The communications can either be IPv6 initiated or IPv4 initiated. The IVI mechanism supports the end-to-end address transparency and incremental deployment. The IVI is an early design deployed in the CERNET as a reference for the IETF standard documents on IPv4/IPv6 stateless translation.
