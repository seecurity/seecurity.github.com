Performance-Based Path Selection for
Explicitly Routed Label Switched Paths
(LSPs) Using TE Metric Extensions
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In certain networks, it is critical to consider network performance criteria when selecting the path for an explicitly routed RSVP-TE Label Switched Path (LSP).  Such performance criteria can include latency, jitter, and loss or other indications such as the conformance to link performance objectives and non-RSVP TE traffic load.  This specification describes how a path computation function may use network performance data, such as is advertised via the OSPF and IS-IS TE metric extensions (defined outside the scope of this document) to perform such path selections."];

A Path Computation Element (PCE)-Based

This document specifies the architecture for a Path Computation Element (PCE)-based model to address this problem space.
