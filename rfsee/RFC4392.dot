This document presents an overview of the InfiniBand architecture. It further describes the requirements and guidelines for the transmission of IP over InfiniBand. Discussions in this document are applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6 unless explicitly specified. The encapsulation of IP over InfiniBand and the mechanism for IP address resolution on IB fabrics are covered in other documents. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
