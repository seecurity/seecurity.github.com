Multicast Mobility in Mobile IP Version
6 (MIPv6): Problem Statement and Brief
Survey
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document discusses current mobility extensions to IP-layer multicast.  It describes problems arising from mobile group communication in general, the case of multicast listener mobility, and problems for mobile senders using Any Source Multicast and Source-Specific Multicast.  Characteristic aspects of multicast routing and deployment issues for fixed IPv6 networks are summarized.  Specific properties and interplays with the underlying network access are surveyed with respect to the relevant technologies in the wireless domain.  It outlines the principal approaches to multicast mobility, together with a comprehensive exploration of the mobile multicast problem and solution space.  This document concludes with a conceptual road map for initial steps in standardization for use by future mobile multicast protocol designers.

Base Deployment for Multicast Listener
Support in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)
Domains
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6224.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes deployment options for activating multicast listener functions in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains without modifying mobility and multicast protocol standards.  Similar to home agents in Mobile IPv6, Local Mobility Anchors of Proxy Mobile IPv6 serve as multicast subscription anchor points, while Mobile Access Gateways provide Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) proxy functions.  In this scenario, mobile nodes remain agnostic of multicast mobility operations.  Support for mobile multicast senders is outside the scope of this document.

A Common API for Transparent Hybrid
Multicast
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7046.html", target="_top", tooltip="Group communication services exist in a large variety of flavors and technical implementations at different protocol layers.  Multicast data distribution is most efficiently performed on the lowest available layer, but a heterogeneous deployment status of multicast technologies throughout the Internet requires an adaptive service binding at runtime.  Today, it is difficult to write an application that runs everywhere and at the same time makes use of the most efficient multicast service available in the network.  Facing robustness requirements, developers are frequently forced to use a stable upper-layer protocol provided by the application itself.  This document describes a common multicast API that is suitable for transparent communication in underlay and overlay and that grants access to the different flavors of multicast.  It proposes an abstract naming scheme that uses multicast URIs, and it discusses mapping mechanisms between different namespaces and distribution technologies.  Additionally, this document describes the application of this API for building gateways that interconnect current Multicast Domains throughout the Internet.  It reports on an implementation of the programming Interface, including service middleware.  This document is a product of the Scalable Adaptive Multicast (SAM) Research Group."];

Mobile Multicast Sender Support in Proxy
Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) Domains
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7287.html", target="_top", tooltip="Multicast communication can be enabled in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domains via the Local Mobility Anchors by deploying Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) proxy functions at Mobile Access Gateways, by using direct traffic distribution within an ISP's access network, or by selective route optimization schemes.  This document describes a base solution and an experimental protocol to support mobile multicast senders in PMIPv6 domains for all three scenarios.  Protocol optimizations for synchronizing PMIPv6 with PIM, as well as a peering function for MLD proxies are defined.  Mobile sources always remain agnostic of multicast mobility operations."];

Multicast Listener Extensions for Mobile
IPv6 (MIPv6) and Proxy Mobile IPv6
(PMIPv6) Fast Handovers
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7411.html", target="_top", tooltip="Fast handover protocols for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) and Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) define mobility management procedures that support unicast communication at reduced handover latency. Fast handover base operations do not affect multicast communication and, hence, do not accelerate handover management for native multicast listeners. Many multicast applications like IPTV or conferencing, though, comprise delay-sensitive, real-time traffic and will benefit from fast handover completion. This document specifies extension of the Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers (FMIPv6) and the Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PFMIPv6) protocols to include multicast traffic management in fast handover operations. This multicast support is provided first at the control plane by management of rapid context transfer between access routers and second at the data plane by optional fast traffic forwarding that may include buffering. An FMIPv6 access router indicates support for multicast using an updated Proxy Router Advertisements message format. This document updates RFC 5568, Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers."];
