Multicast Virtual Private Network
(MVPN): Using Bidirectional P-Tunnels
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="A set of prior RFCs specify procedures for supporting multicast in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  These procedures allow customer multicast data to travel across a service provider's backbone network through a set of multicast tunnels.  The tunnels are advertised in certain BGP multicast auto-discovery routes, by means of a BGP attribute known as the Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel attribute.  Encodings have been defined that allow the PMSI Tunnel attribute to identify bidirectional (multipoint-to-multipoint) multicast distribution trees.  However, the prior RFCs do not provide all the necessary procedures for using bidirectional tunnels to support multicast VPNs.  This document updates RFCs 6513, 6514, and 6625 by specifying those procedures.  In particular, it specifies the procedures for assigning customer multicast flows (unidirectional or bidirectional) to specific bidirectional tunnels in the provider backbone, for advertising such assignments, and for determining which flows have been assigned to which tunnels.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

MVPN/EVPN Tunnel Aggregation with Common
Labels

The EVPN specifications allow a single P2MP tunnel to carry traffic of multiple Broadcast Domains (BDs).  These features require the ingress router of the P2MP tunnel to allocate an upstream-assigned MPLS label for each VPN or for each BD.  A packet sent on a P2MP tunnel then carries the label that is mapped to its VPN or BD (in some cases, a distinct upstream-assigned label is needed for each flow.) Since each ingress router allocates labels independently, with no coordination among the ingress routers, the egress routers may need to keep track of a large number of labels.  The number of labels may need to be as large as, or larger than, the product of the number of ingress routers times the number of VPNs or BDs.  However, the number of labels can be greatly reduced if the association between a label and a VPN or BD is made by provisioning, so that all ingress routers assign the same label to a particular VPN or BD.  New procedures are needed in order to take advantage of such provisioned labels.  These new procedures also apply to Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) tunnels.

One type of P2MP tree that may be used is known as an Ingress Replication (IR) tunnel.  In an IR tunnel, a parent node need not be directly connected to its child nodes.  When a parent node has to send a multicast data packet to its n child nodes, it does not use Layer 2 multicast, IP multicast, or MPLS multicast to do so.  Rather, it makes n individual copies, and then unicasts each copy, through an IP or MPLS unicast tunnel, to exactly one child node.
