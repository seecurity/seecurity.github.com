BGPsec Router Certificate Rollover

This document describes a safe rollover process, and it discusses when and why the rollover of BGPsec router certificates is necessary.  When this rollover process is followed, the rollover will be performed without routing information being lost.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

In general, RPs are expected to maintain a local cache of the objects that have been published in the RPKI repository, and thus the way in which a CA performs key rollover impacts RPs.

BGPsec is implemented via an optional non-transitive BGP path attribute that carries digital signatures produced by each AS that propagates the UPDATE message.  The digital signatures provide confidence that every AS on the path of ASes listed in the UPDATE message has explicitly authorized the advertisement of the route."];
