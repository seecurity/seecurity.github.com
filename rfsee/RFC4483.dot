It can be difficult to locate the right document, or even to determine the set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP.  This specification serves as a guide to the SIP RFC series.  It lists a current snapshot of the specifications under the SIP umbrella, briefly summarizes each, and groups them into categories.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

A Session Description Protocol (SDP)
Offer/Answer Mechanism to Enable File
Transfer
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5547.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides a mechanism to negotiate the transfer of one or more files between two endpoints by using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer model specified in RFC 3264.  SDP is extended to describe the attributes of the files to be transferred.  The offerer can describe either the files it wants to send or the files it would like to receive.  The answerer can either accept or reject the offer separately for each individual file.  The transfer of one or more files is initiated after a successful negotiation.  The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is defined as the default mechanism to actually carry the files between the endpoints.  The conventions on how to use MSRP for file transfer are also provided in this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The framework provides a means to deliver profile data that user agents need to be functional, automatically and with minimal or no User and Administrative intervention.  The framework describes how SIP user agents can discover sources, request profiles, and receive notifications related to profile modifications.  As part of this framework, a new SIP event package is defined for notification of profile changes.  The framework provides minimal data retrieval options to ensure interoperability.

Note that the event notification mechanisms defined herein are NOT intended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for all classes of event subscription and notification. This document represents a backwards-compatible improvement on the original mechanism described by RFC 3265, taking into account several years of implementation experience.
