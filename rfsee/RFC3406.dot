Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace
Registration Transition
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8254.html", target="_top", tooltip="The original registration procedure for formal Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespaces required IETF Consensus.  That requirement discouraged some registrations and increased the risk for problems that could occur as a result.  The requirements have now been changed by RFC 8141, which adopts a different model, focusing on encouraging registration and publication of information for all appropriate namespaces.  This document clarifies the status of relevant older RFCs and confirms and documents advice to IANA about selected existing registrations.  This document also obsoletes RFCs 3044 and 3187 and moves them to Historic status.  These RFCs describe the ISSN and ISBN namespaces, which are now outdated because the descriptions reside in registration templates."];

Using National Bibliography Numbers as
Uniform Resource Names
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8458.html", target="_top", tooltip="National Bibliography Numbers (NBNs) are used by national libraries and other organizations in order to identify resources in their collections. NBNs are usually applied to resources that are not catered for by established (standard) identifier systems such as International Standard Book Number (ISBN). A Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for NBNs was established in 2001 in RFC 3188. Since then, a number of European national libraries have implemented URN:NBN-based systems. This document replaces RFC 3188 and defines how NBNs can be supported within the updated URN framework. A revised namespace registration (version 4) compliant to RFC 8141 is included."];
