Technical Considerations for Internet
Service Blocking and Filtering
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7754.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by certain parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of abusive or objectionable communications.  Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on blocking and filtering, the active prevention of such communications.  This document examines several technical approaches to Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet architecture.  When it is possible to do so, the approach to blocking and filtering that is most coherent with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or objectionable communications.  We observe that certain filtering and blocking approaches can cause unintended consequences to third parties, and we discuss the limits of efficacy of various approaches."];

This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793.  This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793.  It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements.  It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state.  The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168."];
