A Message Bus for Local Coordination
2002", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The local Message Bus (Mbus) is a light-weight message-oriented coordination protocol for group communication between application components.  The Mbus provides automatic location of communication peers, subject based addressing, reliable message transfer and different types of communication schemes.  The protocol is layered on top of IP multicast and is specified for IPv4 and IPv6.  The IP multicast scope is limited to link-local multicast.  This document specifies the Mbus protocol, i.e., message syntax, addressing and transport mechanisms.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI)
S-Expressions

It has been and is being used elsewhere.  There are multiple implementations in a variety of programming languages.  Uses of this representation are referred to in this document as S-expressions.  This memo makes precise the encodings of these SPKI S-expressions: It gives a canonical form for them, describes two transport representations, and also describes an advanced format for display to people."];
