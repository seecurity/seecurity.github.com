The CCITT and the ISO have defined various session, presentation, and application recommendations which have been adopted by the international community and numerous vendors.  To the largest extent possible, it is desirable to offer these higher level services directly in the ARPA Internet, without disrupting existing facilities.  This permits users to develop expertise with ISO and CCITT applications which previously were not available in the ARPA Internet.  The intention is that hosts in the ARPA-Internet that choose to implement ISO TSAP services on top of the TCP be expected to adopt and implement this standard.  Suggestions for improvement are encouraged."];

ISO presentation services on top of

1988", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC1085.html", target="_top", tooltip="RFC 1006 describes a mechanism for providing the ISO transport service on top of TCP/IP.  Once this method is applied, one may implement real ISO applications on top of TCP/IP-based internets, by simply implementing OSI session, presentation, and application services on top of the transport service access point which is provided on top of the TCP.  Although straight-forward, there are some environments in which the richness provided by the OSI application layer is desired, but it is nonetheless impractical to implement the underlying OSI infrastructure (i.e., the presentation, session, and transport services on top of the TCP).  This memo describes an approach for providing stream-lined support of OSI application services on top of TCP/IP-based internets for such constrained environments.
