X.509v3 Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Feature Extension
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The purpose of the TLS feature extension is to prevent downgrade attacks that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS protocol.  In particular, the TLS feature extension may be used to mandate support for revocation checking features in the TLS protocol such as Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) stapling.  Informing clients that an OCSP status response will always be stapled permits an immediate failure in the case that the response is not stapled.  This in turn prevents a denial-of-service attack that might otherwise be possible.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

The intent is that eventually clients would refuse to honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs. This document obsoletes RFC 6962. It also specifies a new TLS extension that is used to send various CT log artifacts. Logs are network services that implement the protocol operations for submissions and queries that are defined in this document."];

Recommendations for Secure Use of

Over the years, the industry has witnessed several serious attacks on TLS and DTLS, including attacks on the most commonly used cipher suites and their modes of operation. This document provides the latest recommendations for ensuring the security of deployed services that use TLS and DTLS. These recommendations are applicable to the majority of use cases. RFC 7525, an earlier version of the TLS recommendations, was published when the industry was transitioning to TLS 1.2. Years later, this transition is largely complete, and TLS 1.3 is widely available. This document updates the guidance given the new environment and obsoletes RFC 7525. In addition, this document updates RFCs 5288 and 6066 in view of recent attacks."];
