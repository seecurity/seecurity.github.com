Multicast Router Discovery
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The concept of Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) snooping requires the ability to identify the location of multicast routers. Since snooping is not standardized, there are many mechanisms in use to identify the multicast routers. However, this can lead to interoperability issues between multicast routers and snooping switches from different vendors. This document introduces a general mechanism that allows for the discovery of multicast routers. This new mechanism, Multicast Router Discovery (MRD), introduces a standardized means of identifying multicast routers without a dependency on particular multicast routing protocols.

Recommendations for Filtering ICMPv6
Messages in Firewalls
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4890.html", target="_top", tooltip="In networks supporting IPv6, the Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) plays a fundamental role with a large number of functions, and a correspondingly large number of message types and options. ICMPv6 is essential to the functioning of IPv6, but there are a number of security risks associated with uncontrolled forwarding of ICMPv6 messages. Filtering strategies designed for the corresponding protocol, ICMP, in IPv4 networks are not directly applicable, because these strategies are intended to accommodate a useful auxiliary protocol that may not be required for correct functioning. This document provides some recommendations for ICMPv6 firewall filter configuration that will allow propagation of ICMPv6 messages that are needed to maintain the functioning of the network but drop messages that are potential security risks. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Transparent Interconnection of Lots of
Links (TRILL): Problem and Applicability
Statement
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5556.html", target="_top", tooltip="Current IEEE 802.1 LANs use spanning tree protocols that have a number of challenges.  These protocols need to strictly avoid loops, even temporary ones, during route propagation, because of the lack of header loop detection support.  Routing tends not to take full advantage of alternate paths, or even non-overlapping pairwise paths (in the case of spanning trees).  This document addresses these concerns and suggests applying modern network-layer routing protocols at the link layer.  This document assumes that solutions would not address issues of scalability beyond that of existing IEEE 802.1 bridged links, but that a solution would be backward compatible with 802.1, including hubs, bridges, and their existing plug-and-play capabilities.

Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base
Protocol Specification
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6325.html", target="_top", tooltip="Routing Bridges (RBridges) provide optimal pair-wise forwarding without configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. They achieve these goals using IS-IS routing and encapsulation of traffic with a header that includes a hop count. RBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are as invisible to current IP routers as bridges are and, like routers, they terminate the bridge spanning tree protocol. The design supports VLANs and the optimization of the distribution of multi-destination frames based on VLAN ID and based on IP-derived multicast groups. It also allows unicast forwarding tables at transit RBridges to be sized according to the number of RBridges (rather than the number of end nodes), which allows their forwarding tables to be substantially smaller than in conventional customer bridges.

IP Router Alert Considerations and Usage
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6398.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IP Router Alert Option is an IP option that alerts transit routers to more closely examine the contents of an IP packet.  The Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP), Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM), the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD), Multicast Router Discovery (MRD), and General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) are some of the protocols that make use of the IP Router Alert Option.  This document discusses security aspects and usage guidelines around the use of the current IP Router Alert Option, thereby updating RFC 2113 and RFC 2711.  Specifically, it provides recommendations against using the Router Alert in the end-to-end open Internet and identifies controlled environments where protocols depending on Router Alert can be used safely.  It also provides recommendations about protection approaches for service providers.  Finally, it provides brief guidelines for Router Alert implementation on routers.
