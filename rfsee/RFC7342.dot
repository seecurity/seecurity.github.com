Neighbor Unreachability Detection Is Too
Impatient
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7048.html", target="_top", tooltip="IPv6 Neighbor Discovery includes Neighbor Unreachability Detection.  That function is very useful when a host has an alternative neighbor -- for instance, when there are multiple default routers -- since it allows the host to switch to the alternative neighbor in a short time.  By default, this time is 3 seconds after the node starts probing.  However, if there are no alternative neighbors, this timeout behavior is far too impatient.  This document specifies relaxed rules for Neighbor Discovery retransmissions that allow an implementation to choose different timeout behavior based on whether or not there are alternative neighbors.

SARP is based on fast proxies that significantly reduce switches' Filtering Database (FDB) table sizes and reduce impact of ARP and Neighbor Discovery (ND) on network elements in an environment where hosts within one subnet (or VLAN) can spread over various locations.  SARP is targeted for massive data centers with a significant number of Virtual Machines (VMs) that can move across various physical locations."];

Neighbor Discovery Considerations in
IPv6 Deployments
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9898.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol is a critical component of the
IPv6 architecture. The protocol uses multicast in many messages. It
also assumes a security model where all nodes on a link are trusted.
Such a design might be inefficient in some scenarios (e.g., use of
multicast in wireless networks) or when nodes are not trustworthy
(e.g., public access networks). These security and operational issues
and the associated mitigation solutions are documented in more than
twenty RFCs. There is a need to track these issues and solutions in a
single document. To that aim, this document summarizes the published ND issues and
then describes how all these issues originate from three causes.
Addressing the issues is made simpler by addressing the causes. This
document also analyzes the mitigation solutions and demonstrates that
isolating hosts into different subnets and links can help to address
the three causes. Guidance is provided for selecting a suitable
isolation method to prevent potential ND issues."];
