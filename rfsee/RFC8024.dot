Multi-Chassis Passive Optical Network
(MC-PON) Protection in MPLS
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is being extended to the edge of operator networks including the network access nodes.  Separately, network access nodes such as Passive Optical Network (PON) Optical Line Terminations (OLTs) have evolved to support first-mile access protection, where one or more physical OLTs provide first-mile diversity to the customer edge.  Multihoming support is needed on the MPLS-enabled PON OLT to provide resiliency for provided services.  This document describes the Multi-Chassis PON (MC-PON) protection architecture in MPLS and also specifies the Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol (ICCP) extension to support it."];

Multi-Segment Pseudowires in Passive
Optical Networks
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6456.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the application of MPLS multi-segment pseudowires (MS-PWs) in a dual-technology environment comprising a Passive Optical Network (PON) and an MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN). PON technology may be used in mobile backhaul networks to support the end segments closest to the aggregation devices. In these cases, there may be a very large number of pseudowire (PW) Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE) nodes. The MPLS control plane could be used to provision these end segments, but support for the necessary protocols would complicate the management of the T-PEs and would significantly increase their expense. Alternatively, static, or management plane, configuration could be used to configure the end segments, but the very large number of such segments in a PON places a very heavy burden on the network manager. This document describes how to set up the end segment of an end-to- end MPLS PW over a Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (G-PON) or 10 Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (XG-PON) using the G-PON and XG-PON management protocol, Optical Network Termination Management and Control Interface (OMCI). This simplifies and speeds up PW provisioning compared with manual configuration. This document also shows how an MS-PW may be constructed from an end segment supported over a PON, and switched to one or more segments supported over an MPLS PSN. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol for

Provider Edge (PE) Redundancy
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7275.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies an Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol (ICCP) that enables Provider Edge (PE) device redundancy for Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) applications.  The protocol runs within a set of two or more PEs, forming a Redundancy Group, for the purpose of synchronizing data among the systems.  It accommodates multi-chassis attachment circuit redundancy mechanisms as well as pseudowire redundancy mechanisms."];

Pseudowire Preferential Forwarding
Status Bit
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6870.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism for signaling the active and standby status of redundant Pseudowires (PWs) between their termination points. A set of Redundant PWs is configured between Provider Edge (PE) nodes in single-segment pseudowire (SS-PW) applications or between Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE) nodes in Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) applications. In order for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW to use for forwarding PW packets to one another, a new status bit is defined. This bit indicates a Preferential Forwarding status with a value of active or standby for each PW in a redundant set. In addition, a second status bit is defined to allow peer PE nodes to coordinate a switchover operation of the PW. Finally, this document updates RFC 4447 by adding details to the handling of the PW status code bits in the PW Status TLV."];
