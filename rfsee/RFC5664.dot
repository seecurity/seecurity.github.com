Object-Based Parallel NFS (pNFS)
Operations
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) to allow clients to directly access file data on the storage used by the NFSv4 server.  This ability to bypass the server for data access can increase both performance and parallelism, but requires additional client functionality for data access, some of which is dependent on the class of storage used, a.k.a.  the Layout Type.  The main pNFS operations and data types in NFSv4 Minor version 1 specify a layout- type-independent layer; layout-type-specific information is conveyed using opaque data structures whose internal structure is further defined by the particular layout type specification.  This document specifies the NFSv4.1 Object-Based pNFS Layout Type as a companion to the main NFSv4 Minor version 1 specification. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Requirements for Parallel NFS (pNFS)
Layout Types
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8434.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the requirements that individual Parallel NFS (pNFS) layout types need to meet in order to work within the pNFS framework as defined in RFC 5661.  In so doing, this document aims to clearly distinguish between requirements for pNFS as a whole and those specifically directed to the pNFS file layout.  The lack of a clear separation between the two sets of requirements has been troublesome for those specifying and evaluating new layout types.  In this regard, this document updates RFC 5661."];

Overview and Principles of Internet
Traffic Engineering
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9522.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the principles of traffic engineering (TE) in the Internet. The document is intended to promote better understanding of the issues surrounding traffic engineering in IP networks and the networks that support IP networking and to provide a common basis for the development of traffic-engineering capabilities for the Internet. The principles, architectures, and methodologies for performance evaluation and performance optimization of operational networks are also discussed. This work was first published as RFC 3272 in May 2002. This document obsoletes RFC 3272 by making a complete update to bring the text in line with best current practices for Internet traffic engineering and to include references to the latest relevant work in the IETF."];
