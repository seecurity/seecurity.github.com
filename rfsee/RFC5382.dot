Defending TCP Against Spoofing Attacks
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4953.html", target="_top", tooltip="Recent analysis of potential attacks on core Internet infrastructure indicates an increased vulnerability of TCP connections to spurious resets (RSTs), sent with forged IP source addresses (spoofing).  TCP has always been susceptible to such RST spoofing attacks, which were indirectly protected by checking that the RST sequence number was inside the current receive window, as well as via the obfuscation of TCP endpoint and port numbers.  For pairs of well-known endpoints often over predictable port pairs, such as BGP or between web servers and well-known large-scale caches, increases in the path bandwidth-delay product of a connection have sufficiently increased the receive window space that off-path third parties can brute-force generate a viable RST sequence number.  The susceptibility to attack increases with the square of the bandwidth, and thus presents a significant vulnerability for recent high-speed networks.  This document addresses this vulnerability, discussing proposed solutions at the transport level and their inherent challenges, as well as existing network level solutions and the feasibility of their deployment.

TCP-ENO: Encryption Negotiation Option
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8547.html", target="_top", tooltip="Despite growing adoption of TLS, a significant fraction of TCP traffic on the Internet remains unencrypted.  The persistence of unencrypted traffic can be attributed to at least two factors.  First, some legacy protocols lack a signaling mechanism (such as a STARTTLS command) by which to convey support for encryption, thus making incremental deployment impossible.  Second, legacy applications themselves cannot always be upgraded and therefore require a way to implement encryption transparently entirely within the transport layer.  The TCP Encryption Negotiation Option (TCP-ENO) addresses both of these problems through a new TCP option kind providing out-of-band, fully backward-compatible negotiation of encryption."];

Apple's DNS Long-Lived Queries Protocol
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8764.html", target="_top", tooltip="Apple's DNS Long-Lived Queries (LLQ) is a mechanism for extending the DNS protocol to support change notification, thus allowing clients to learn about changes to DNS data without polling the server. From 2005 onwards, LLQ was implemented in Apple products including Mac OS X, Bonjour for Windows, and AirPort wireless base stations. In 2020, the LLQ protocol was superseded by the IETF Standards Track RFC 8765, DNS Push Notifications, which builds on experience gained with the LLQ protocol to create a superior replacement. The existing LLQ protocol deployed and used from 2005 to 2020 is documented here to give background regarding the operational experience that informed the development of DNS Push Notifications, and to help facilitate a smooth transition from LLQ to DNS Push Notifications."];

TCP Usage Guidance in the Internet of
Things (IoT)
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9006.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides guidance on how to implement and use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in Constrained-Node Networks (CNNs), which are a characteristic of the Internet of Things (IoT).  Such environments require a lightweight TCP implementation and may not make use of optional functionality.  This document explains a number of known and deployed techniques to simplify a TCP stack as well as corresponding trade-offs.  The objective is to help embedded developers with decisions on which TCP features to use."];

Manageability of the QUIC Transport
Protocol
