Quality-of-Service Option for Proxy
Mobile IPv6
2014", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This specification defines a new mobility option, the Quality-of- Service (QoS) option, for Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This option can be used by the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway for negotiating Quality-of-Service parameters for a mobile node's IP flows.  The negotiated QoS parameters can be used for QoS policing and marking of packets to enforce QoS differentiation on the path between the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway.  Furthermore, making QoS parameters available on the mobile access gateway enables mapping of these parameters to QoS rules that are specific to the access technology and allows those rules to be enforced on the access network using access-technology-specific approaches."];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA. This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
