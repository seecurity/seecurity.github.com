Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning
(WebDAV) Redirect Reference Resources
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This specification defines an extension to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) to allow clients to author HTTP redirect reference resources whose default response is an HTTP/1.1 3xx (Redirection) status code.  A redirect reference makes it possible to access the target resourced indirectly through any URI mapped to the redirect reference resource.  This specification does not address remapping of trees of resources or regular expression based redirections.  There are no integrity guarantees associated with redirect reference resources.  Other mechanisms can also be used to achieve the same functionality as this specification.  This specification allows operators to experiment with this mechanism and develop experience on what is the best approach to the problem.

This specification defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.  The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
