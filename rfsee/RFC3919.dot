Remote Network Monitoring (RMON)
Protocol Identifiers for IPv6 and Multi
Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This memo defines additional (to those in RFC 2896) protocol identifier examples for IP version 6 and MPLS protocols. These can be used to produce valid protocolDirTable ``INDEX`` encodings, as defined by the Remote Network Monitoring MIB (Management Information Base) Version 2 [RFC2021] and the RMON Protocol Identifier Reference [RFC2895]. This document contains additional (to those in RFC 2896) protocol identifier macros for well-known protocols. A conformant implementation of the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] can be accomplished without the use of these protocol identifiers, and accordingly, this document does not specify any IETF standard. It is published to encourage better interoperability between RMON-2 agent implementations, by providing RMON related IPv6 and MPLS protocol information. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Introduction and Applicability

Management Framework
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3410.html", target="_top", tooltip="The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the third version of the Internet-Standard Management Framework, termed the SNMP version 3 Framework (SNMPv3).  This Framework is derived from and builds upon both the original Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv1) and the second Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv2).  The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the Framework over time.  The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.  The document also recommends that RFCs 1157, 1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic status.  This document obsoletes RFC 2570.
