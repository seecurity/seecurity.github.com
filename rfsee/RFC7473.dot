Controlling State Advertisements of Non-
negotiated LDP Applications
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="There is no capability negotiation done for Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) applications that set up Label Switched Paths (LSPs) for IP prefixes or that signal point-to-point (P2P) Pseudowires (PWs) for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs).  When an LDP session comes up, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state for such LDP applications even when the peer session is established for some other applications like Multipoint LDP (mLDP) or the Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol (ICCP).  This document defines a solution by which an LDP speaker announces to its peer its disinterest in such non-negotiated applications, thus disabling the unnecessary advertisement of corresponding application state, which would have otherwise been advertised over the established LDP session.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Label Distribution Protocol Extensions

Protocol elements and procedures for this solution are described for building such LSPs in a receiver-initiated manner.  There can be various applications for multipoint LSPs, for example IP multicast or support for multicast in BGP/MPLS Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs).  Specification of how such applications can use an LDP signaled multipoint LSP is outside the scope of this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Multiple VPLS services can be supported from a single Provider Edge (PE) node. This document describes the control plane functions of signaling pseudowire labels using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), extending RFC 4447. It is agnostic to discovery protocols. The data plane functions of forwarding are also described, focusing in particular on the learning of MAC addresses. The encapsulation of VPLS packets is described by RFC 4448. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

LDP Specification

This document defines a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths.
