TCP and Stream Control Transmission
Protocol (SCTP) RTO Restart

The modification, RTO Restart (RTOR), allows the transport to restart its retransmission timer using a smaller timeout duration, so that the effective retransmission timeout (RTO) becomes more aggressive in situations where fast retransmit cannot be used.

Stream Control Transmission Protocol

SCTP is designed to transport Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks, but is capable of broader applications. SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet network such as IP. It offers the following services to its users: -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data, -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size, -- sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages, -- optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association. The design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The Eifel Detection Algorithm for TCP
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3522.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Eifel detection algorithm allows a TCP sender to detect a posteriori whether it has entered loss recovery unnecessarily.  It requires that the TCP Timestamps option defined in RFC 1323 be enabled for a connection.  The Eifel detection algorithm makes use of the fact that the TCP Timestamps option eliminates the retransmission ambiguity in TCP.  Based on the timestamp of the first acceptable ACK that arrives during loss recovery, it decides whether loss recovery was entered unnecessarily.  The Eifel detection algorithm provides a basis for future TCP enhancements.  This includes response algorithms to back out of loss recovery by restoring a TCP sender's congestion control state.

Forward RTO-Recovery (F-RTO): An
Algorithm for Detecting Spurious
Retransmission Timeouts with TCP
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5682.html", target="_top", tooltip="The purpose of this document is to move the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) functionality for TCP in RFC 4138 from Experimental to Standards Track status. The F-RTO support for Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) in RFC 4138 remains with Experimental status. See Appendix B for the differences between this document and RFC 4138. Spurious retransmission timeouts cause suboptimal TCP performance because they often result in unnecessary retransmission of the last window of data. This document describes the F-RTO detection algorithm for detecting spurious TCP retransmission timeouts. F-RTO is a TCP sender-only algorithm that does not require any TCP options to operate. After retransmitting the first unacknowledged segment triggered by a timeout, the F-RTO algorithm of the TCP sender monitors the incoming acknowledgments to determine whether the timeout was spurious. It then decides whether to send new segments or retransmit unacknowledged segments. The algorithm effectively helps to avoid additional unnecessary retransmissions and thereby improves TCP performance in the case of a spurious timeout. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

In addition, the Eifel response algorithm restores the congestion control state in such a way that packet bursts are avoided. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The RACK-TLP Loss Detection Algorithm
for TCP

RACK-TLP uses per-segment transmit timestamps and selective acknowledgments (SACKs) and has two parts.  Recent Acknowledgment (RACK) starts fast recovery quickly using time-based inferences derived from acknowledgment (ACK) feedback, and Tail Loss Probe (TLP) leverages RACK and sends a probe packet to trigger ACK feedback to avoid retransmission timeout (RTO) events.  Compared to the widely used duplicate acknowledgment (DupAck) threshold approach, RACK-TLP detects losses more efficiently when there are application-limited flights of data, lost retransmissions, or data packet reordering events.  It is intended to be an alternative to the DupAck threshold approach."];
