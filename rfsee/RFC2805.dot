Gateway Control Protocol Version 1
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3525.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the protocol used between elements of a physically decomposed multimedia gateway, i.e., a Media Gateway and a Media Gateway Controller.  The protocol presented in this document meets the requirements for a media gateway control protocol as presented in RFC 2805.  This document replaces RFC 3015.  It is the result of continued cooperation between the IETF Megaco Working Group and ITU-T Study Group 16.  It incorporates the original text of RFC 3015, modified by corrections and clarifications discussed on the Megaco E-mail list and incorporated into the Study Group 16 Implementor's Guide for Recommendation H.248.  The present version of this document underwent ITU-T Last Call as Recommendation H.248 Amendment 1.  Because of ITU-T renumbering, it was published by the ITU-T as Recommendation H.248.1 (03/2002), Gateway Control Protocol Version 1.  Users of this specification are advised to consult the H.248 Sub-series Implementors' Guide at http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/com16/implgd for additional corrections and clarifications.

IP Connectivity Provisioning Profile
(CPP)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7297.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP) and proposes a CPP template to capture IP/MPLS connectivity requirements to be met within a service delivery context (e.g., Voice over IP or IP TV). The CPP defines the set of IP transfer parameters to be supported by the underlying transport network together with a reachability scope and bandwidth/capacity needs. Appropriate performance metrics, such as one-way delay or one-way delay variation, are used to characterize an IP transfer service. Both global and restricted reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP. Such a generic CPP template is meant to (1) facilitate the automation of the service negotiation and activation procedures, thus accelerating service provisioning, (2) set (traffic) objectives of Traffic Engineering functions and service management functions, and (3) improve service and network management systems with 'decision- making' capabilities based upon negotiated/offered CPPs."];
