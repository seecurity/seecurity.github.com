PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Experience has shown that it is difficult to deploy proper PKIX certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in multi-tenanted environments.  As a result, domains hosted in such environments often deploy applications using certificates that identify the hosting service, not the hosted domain.  Such deployments force end users and peer services to accept a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting in degraded security.  This document defines methods that make it easier to deploy certificates for proper server identity checking in non-HTTP application protocols.  Although these methods were developed for use in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain Name Association (DNA) prooftype, they might also be usable in other non-HTTP application protocols."];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA

Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role.
