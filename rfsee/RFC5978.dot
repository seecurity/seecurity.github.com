Requirements for Signaling Protocols
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3726.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines requirements for signaling across different network environments, such as across administrative and/or technology domains.  Signaling is mainly considered for Quality of Service (Qos) such as the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP).  However, in recent years, several other applications of signaling have been defined.  For example, signaling for label distribution in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) or signaling to middleboxes.  To achieve wide applicability of the requirements, the starting point is a diverse set of scenarios/use cases concerning various types of networks and application interactions.  This document presents the assumptions before listing the requirements.  The requirements are grouped according to areas such as architecture and design goals, signaling flows, layering, performance, flexibility, security, and mobility.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

GIST: General Internet Signalling
Transport
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5971.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies protocol stacks for the routing and transport of per-flow signalling messages along the path taken by that flow through the network.  The design uses existing transport and security protocols under a common messaging layer, the General Internet Signalling Transport (GIST), which provides a common service for diverse signalling applications.  GIST does not handle signalling application state itself, but manages its own internal state and the configuration of the underlying transport and security protocols to enable the transfer of messages in both directions along the flow path.  The combination of GIST and the lower layer transport and security protocols provides a solution for the base protocol component of the Next Steps in Signalling (NSIS) framework.

NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for
Quality-of-Service Signaling

It is in accordance with the framework and requirements developed in NSIS.  Together with General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST), it provides functionality similar to RSVP and extends it.  The QoS NSLP is independent of the underlying QoS specification or architecture and provides support for different reservation models.  It is simplified by the elimination of support for multicast flows.  This specification explains the overall protocol approach, describes the design decisions made, and provides examples.  It specifies object, message formats, and processing rules.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Based on existing work on signaling requirements, this document proposes an architectural framework for these signaling protocols. This document provides a model for the network entities that take part in such signaling, and for the relationship between signaling and the rest of network operation.

QSPEC Template for the Quality-of-

2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5975.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Quality-of-Service (QoS) NSIS signaling layer protocol (NSLP) is used to signal QoS reservations and is independent of a specific QoS model (QOSM) such as IntServ or Diffserv.  Rather, all information specific to a QOSM is encapsulated in a separate object, the QSPEC.  This document defines a template for the QSPEC including a number of QSPEC parameters.  The QSPEC parameters provide a common language to be reused in several QOSMs and thereby aim to ensure the extensibility and interoperability of QoS NSLP.  While the base protocol is QOSM-agnostic, the parameters that can be carried in the QSPEC object are possibly closely coupled to specific models.  The node initiating the NSIS signaling adds an Initiator QSPEC, which indicates the QSPEC parameters that must be interpreted by the downstream nodes less the reservation fails, thereby ensuring the intention of the NSIS initiator is preserved along the signaling path.

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.

Assigning Experimental and Testing
Numbers Considered Useful

For example, to test a new DHCP option, one needs an option number to identify the new function.  This document recommends that when writing IANA Considerations sections, authors should consider assigning a small range of numbers for experimentation purposes that implementers can use when testing protocol extensions or other new features.  This document reserves some ranges of numbers for experimentation purposes in specific protocols where the need to support experimentation has been identified."];

RMD is a technique for adding admission control and preemption function to Differentiated Services (Diffserv) networks.  The RMD QoS Model allows devices external to the RMD network to signal reservation requests to Edge nodes in the RMD network.
