Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating

Ingress Filtering for Multihomed
Networks
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3704.html", target="_top", tooltip="BCP 38, RFC 2827, is designed to limit the impact of distributed denial of service attacks, by denying traffic with spoofed addresses access to the network, and to help ensure that traffic is traceable to its correct source network.  As a side effect of protecting the Internet against such attacks, the network implementing the solution also protects itself from this and other attacks, such as spoofed management access to networking equipment.  There are cases when this may create problems, e.g., with multihoming.  This document describes the current ingress filtering operational mechanisms, examines generic issues related to ingress filtering, and delves into the effects on multihoming in particular.

Black-holing can be applied on a selection of routers rather than all BGP-speaking routers in the network.  The document also describes a sinkhole tunnel technique using BGP communities and tunnels to pull traffic into a sinkhole router for analysis.

The Generalized TTL Security Mechanism
(GTSM)
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3682.html", target="_top", tooltip="The use of a packet's Time to Live (TTL) (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6) to protect a protocol stack from CPU-utilization based attacks has been proposed in many settings (see for example, RFC 2461).  This document generalizes these techniques for use by other protocols such as BGP (RFC 1771), Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP), Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, and Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) (RFC 3036).  While the Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM) is most effective in protecting directly connected protocol peers, it can also provide a lower level of protection to multi-hop sessions.  GTSM is not directly applicable to protocols employing flooding mechanisms (e.g., multicast), and use of multi-hop GTSM should be considered on a case-by-case basis.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

This document defines the two metering and marking behaviours of PCN-nodes.  Threshold-metering and -marking marks all PCN-packets if the rate of PCN-traffic is greater than a configured rate (PCN-threshold-rate).  Excess- traffic-metering and -marking marks a proportion of PCN-packets, such that the amount marked equals the rate of PCN-traffic in excess of a configured rate (PCN-excess-rate).  The level of marking allows PCN-boundary-nodes to make decisions about whether to admit or terminate PCN-flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
