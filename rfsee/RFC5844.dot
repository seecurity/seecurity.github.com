Multicast Listener Extensions for Mobile
IPv6 (MIPv6) and Proxy Mobile IPv6
(PMIPv6) Fast Handovers
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7411.html", target="_top", tooltip="Fast handover protocols for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) and Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) define mobility management procedures that support unicast communication at reduced handover latency. Fast handover base operations do not affect multicast communication and, hence, do not accelerate handover management for native multicast listeners. Many multicast applications like IPTV or conferencing, though, comprise delay-sensitive, real-time traffic and will benefit from fast handover completion. This document specifies extension of the Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers (FMIPv6) and the Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PFMIPv6) protocols to include multicast traffic management in fast handover operations. This multicast support is provided first at the control plane by management of rapid context transfer between access routers and second at the data plane by optional fast traffic forwarding that may include buffering. An FMIPv6 access router indicates support for multicast using an updated Proxy Router Advertisements message format. This document updates RFC 5568, Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers."];

Extensions to the Proxy Mobile IPv6
(PMIPv6) Access Network Identifier
Option

This enables a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to convey identifiers like the network identifier, geolocation, and operator identifier.  This specification extends the Access Network Identifier mobility option with sub-options to carry the civic location and the MAG group identifier.  This specification also defines an ANI Update-Timer sub-option that determines when and how often the ANI option will be updated."];

These attributes can be used for carrying the IPv4 address and IPv6 address of the Proxy-Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF).

Logical-Interface Support for IP Hosts
with Multi-Access Support
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7847.html", target="_top", tooltip="A logical interface is a software semantic internal to the host operating system.  This semantic is available in all popular operating systems and is used in various protocol implementations.  Logical-interface support is required on the mobile node attached to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain for leveraging various network-based mobility management features such as inter-technology handoffs, multihoming, and flow mobility support.  This document explains the operational details of the logical-interface construct and the specifics on how link-layer implementations hide the physical interfaces from the IP stack and from the network nodes on the attached access networks.  Furthermore, this document identifies the applicability of this approach to various link-layer technologies and analyzes the issues around it when used in conjunction with various mobility management features."];

Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation for Data
Frames in Control and Provisioning of
Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8350.html", target="_top", tooltip="Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) is a protocol for encapsulating a station's data frames between the Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller (AC).  Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data frames can be either locally bridged or tunneled to the AC.  When tunneled, a CAPWAP Data Channel is used for tunneling.  In many deployments, encapsulating data frames to an entity other than the AC (for example, to an Access Router (AR)) is desirable.  Furthermore, it may also be desirable to use different tunnel encapsulation modes between the WTP and the Access Router.  This document defines an extension to the CAPWAP protocol that supports this capability and refers to it as alternate tunnel encapsulation.  The alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint different from the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many known encapsulation types, such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, or CAPWAP.  The WTP may advertise support for alternate tunnel encapsulation during the discovery and join process, and the AC may select one of the supported alternate tunnel encapsulation types while configuring the WTP."];
