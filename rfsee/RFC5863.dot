DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

The organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents.  A message can contain multiple signatures, from the same or different organizations involved with the message.  DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for email, using public key cryptography and using the domain name service as its key server technology.  This permits verification of a responsible organization, as well as the integrity of the message content.  DKIM will also provide a mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish information about their email signing practices; this will permit email receivers to make additional assessments about messages.

DKIM allows an organization to take responsibility for transmitting a message, in a way that can be verified by a recipient.  The organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents.  A message can contain multiple signatures from the same or different organizations involved with the message.
