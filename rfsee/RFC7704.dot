An IETF with Much Diversity and
Professional Conduct
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The process of producing today's Internet technologies through a culture of open participation and diverse collaboration has proved strikingly efficient and effective, and it is distinctive among standards organizations.  During the early years of the IETF and its antecedent, participation was almost entirely composed of a small group of well-funded, American, white, male technicians, demonstrating a distinctive and challenging group dynamic, both in management and in personal interactions.  In the case of the IETF, interaction style can often contain singularly aggressive behavior, often including singularly hostile tone and content.  Groups with greater diversity make better decisions.  Obtaining meaningful diversity requires more than generic good will and statements of principle.  Many different behaviors can serve to reduce participant diversity or participation diversity.  This document discusses IETF participation in terms of the nature of diversity and practical issues that can increase or decrease it.  The document represents the authors' assessments and recommendations, following general discussions of the issues in the IETF.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
