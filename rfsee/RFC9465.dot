PIM Null-Register Packing
2023", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) networks, PIM Null-Register messages are sent by the Designated Router (DR) to the Rendezvous Point (RP) to signal the presence of multicast sources in the network. There are periodic PIM Null-Registers sent from the DR to the RP to keep the state alive at the RP as long as the source is active. The PIM Null-Register message carries information about a single multicast source and group. This document defines a standard to send information about multiple multicast sources and groups in a single PIM message. This document refers to the new messages as the PIM Packed Null-Register message and PIM Packed Register-Stop message."];

Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse
Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification
(Revised)
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7761.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM). PIM-SM is a multicast routing protocol that can use the underlying unicast routing information base or a separate multicast-capable routing information base. It builds unidirectional shared trees rooted at a Rendezvous Point (RP) per group, and it optionally creates shortest-path trees per source. This document obsoletes RFC 4601 by replacing it, addresses the errata filed against it, removes the optional (*,*,RP), PIM Multicast Border Router features and authentication using IPsec that lack sufficient deployment experience (see Appendix A), and moves the PIM specification to Internet Standard."];
