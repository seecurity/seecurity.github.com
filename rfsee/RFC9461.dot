Specification for DNS over Transport
Layer Security (TLS)
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7858.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide privacy for DNS. Encryption provided by TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping and on-path tampering with DNS queries in the network, such as discussed in RFC 7626. In addition, this document specifies two usage profiles for DNS over TLS and provides advice on performance considerations to minimize overhead from using TCP and TLS with DNS. This document focuses on securing stub-to-recursive traffic, as per the charter of the DPRIVE Working Group. It does not prevent future applications of the protocol to recursive-to-authoritative traffic."];

DNS over Dedicated QUIC Connections
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9250.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the use of QUIC to provide transport confidentiality for DNS.  The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to those provided by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-line blocking issues inherent with TCP and provides more efficient packet-loss recovery than UDP.  DNS over QUIC (DoQ) has privacy properties similar to DNS over TLS (DoT) specified in RFC 7858, and latency characteristics similar to classic DNS over UDP.  This specification describes the use of DoQ as a general-purpose transport for DNS and includes the use of DoQ for stub to recursive, recursive to authoritative, and zone transfer scenarios."];

An Encrypted DNS Resolver discovered in this manner is referred to as a Designated Resolver.  These mechanisms can be used to move from unencrypted DNS to encrypted DNS when only the IP address of a resolver is known.
