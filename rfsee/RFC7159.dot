Additional services are built on top of the maps. This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO services. Although the ALTO services would primarily be provided by ISPs, other entities, such as content service providers, could also provide ALTO services.

In case of resources with larger or complex data, or in situations where resource continuity is required, replacing or requesting the whole resource is undesirable. Several applications using CoAP need to access parts of the resources.

Voluntary Application Server

The vapid authentication scheme allows a client to include its identity in a signed token with requests that it makes.  The signature can be used by the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server to a single entity.  The identification information can allow the operator of a push service to contact the operator of the application server.

It extends the ALTO cost information service so that applications decide not only 'where' to connect but also 'when'.  This is useful for applications that need to perform bulk data transfer and would like to schedule these transfers during an off-peak hour, for example.  This extension introduces the ALTO Cost Calendar with which an ALTO Server exposes ALTO cost values in JSON arrays where each value corresponds to a given time interval.  The time intervals, as well as other Calendar attributes, are specified in the Information Resources Directory and ALTO Server responses."];
