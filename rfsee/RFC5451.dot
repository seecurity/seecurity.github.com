Development, Deployment, and Operations
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5863.html", target="_top", tooltip="DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows an organization to claim responsibility for transmitting a message, in a way that can be validated by a recipient.  The organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents.  A message can contain multiple signatures, from the same or different organizations involved with the message.  DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for email, using public key cryptography and using the domain name service as its key server technology.  This permits verification of a responsible organization, as well as the integrity of the message content.  DKIM will also provide a mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish information about their email signing practices; this will permit email receivers to make additional assessments about messages.  DKIM's authentication of email identity can assist in the global control of spam and phishing.  This document provides implementation, deployment, operational, and migration considerations for DKIM.

Signatures

This can be an author's organization, an operational relay, or one of their agents. DKIM separates the question of the identity of the Signer of the message from the purported author of the message. Assertion of responsibility is validated through a cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit from author to recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive change to the message content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.

Post-Delivery Message Downgrading for

Upgraded POP and IMAP servers support internationalized messages.  If a POP or IMAP client does not support Email Address Internationalization, a POP or IMAP server cannot deliver internationalized messages to the client and cannot remove the message.  To avoid that situation, this document describes a mechanism for converting internationalized messages into the traditional message format.  As part of the conversion process, message elements that require internationalized treatment are recoded or removed, and receivers are able to recognize that they received messages containing such elements, even if they cannot process the internationalized elements."];
