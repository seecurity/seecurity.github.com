Telnet Protocol Specification
1983", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC0854.html", target="_top", tooltip="This is the specification of the Telnet protocol used for remote terminal access in the ARPA Internet.  The purpose of the TELNET Protocol is to provide a fairly general, bi-directional, eight-bit byte oriented communications facility.  Its primary goal is to allow a standard method of interfacing terminal devices and terminal-oriented processes to each other.  It is envisioned that the protocol may also be used for terminal-terminal communication (linking) and process-process communication (distributed computation).  This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community.  Hosts on the ARPA Internet are expected to adopt and implement this standard.  Obsoletes NIC 18639."];
