IP Flow Information Accounting and
Export Benchmarking Methodology
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6645.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides a methodology and framework for quantifying the performance impact of the monitoring of IP flows on a network device and the export of this information to a Collector.  It identifies the rate at which the IP flows are created, expired, and successfully exported as a new performance metric in combination with traditional throughput.  The metric is only applicable to the devices compliant with RFC 5470, Architecture for IP Flow Information Export.  The methodology quantifies the impact of the IP flow monitoring process on the network equipment.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Terminology for Benchmarking Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) Devices: Basic
Session Setup and Registration
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7501.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides a terminology for benchmarking the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance of devices.  Methodology related to benchmarking SIP devices is described in the companion methodology document (RFC 7502).  Using these two documents, benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different types of devices such as SIP Proxy Servers, Registrars, and Session Border Controllers.  The term performance in this context means the capacity of the Device Under Test (DUT) to process SIP messages.  Media streams are used only to study how they impact the signaling behavior.  The intent of the two documents is to provide a normalized set of tests that will enable an objective comparison of the capacity of SIP devices.  Test setup parameters and a methodology are necessary because SIP allows a wide range of configurations and operational conditions that can influence performance benchmark measurements.  A standard terminology and methodology will ensure that benchmarks have consistent definitions and were obtained following the same procedures."];

Benchmarking Virtual Switches in the

This project has extended the current and completed work of the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group in the IETF and references existing literature.  The Benchmarking Methodology Working Group has traditionally conducted laboratory characterization of dedicated physical implementations of internetworking functions.  Therefore, this memo describes the additional considerations when virtual switches are implemented on general-purpose hardware.  The expanded tests and benchmarks are also influenced by the OPNFV mission to support virtualization of the telco infrastructure."];
