Problem Statement for the Interface to
the Routing System
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7920.html", target="_top", tooltip="Traditionally, routing systems have implemented routing and signaling (e.g., MPLS) to control traffic forwarding in a network. Route computation has been controlled by relatively static policies that define link cost, route cost, or import and export routing policies. Requirements have emerged to more dynamically manage and program routing systems due to the advent of highly dynamic data-center networking, on-demand WAN services, dynamic policy-driven traffic steering and service chaining, the need for real-time security threat responsiveness via traffic control, and a paradigm of separating policy-based decision-making from the router itself. These requirements should allow controlling routing information and traffic paths and extracting network topology information, traffic statistics, and other network analytics from routing systems. This document proposes meeting this need via an Interface to the Routing System (I2RS)."];

North-Bound Distribution of Link-State
and Traffic Engineering (TE) Information
Using BGP
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7752.html", target="_top", tooltip="In a number of environments, a component external to a network is called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and current state of the connections within the network, including Traffic Engineering (TE) information. This is information typically distributed by IGP routing protocols within the network. This document describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE information can be collected from networks and shared with external components using the BGP routing protocol. This is achieved using a new BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding format. The mechanism is applicable to physical and virtual IGP links. The mechanism described is subject to policy control. Applications of this technique include Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) servers and Path Computation Elements (PCEs)."];

Requirements for Subscription to YANG

Based on criteria negotiated as part of a subscription, updates will be pushed to targeted recipients.  Such a capability eliminates the need for periodic polling of YANG datastores by applications and fills a functional gap in existing YANG transports (i.e., Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) and RESTCONF).  Such a service can be summarized as a pub/sub service for YANG datastore updates.  Beyond a set of basic requirements for the service, various refinements are addressed.  These refinements include: periodicity of object updates, filtering out of objects underneath a requested a subtree, and delivery QoS guarantees."];

Application-Layer Traffic Optimization

Security-Related Requirements

The I2RS protocol is implemented by reusing portions of existing IETF protocols and adding new features to them.  One such reuse is of the security features of a secure transport (e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure SHell (SSH) Protocol, Datagram TLS (DTLS)) such as encryption, message integrity, mutual peer authentication, and anti-replay protection.  The new I2RS features to consider from a security perspective are as follows: a priority mechanism to handle multi-headed write transactions, an opaque secondary identifier that identifies an application using the I2RS client, and an extremely constrained read-only non-secure transport."];

An Extension for Application-Layer
Traffic Optimization (ALTO): Entity
Property Maps
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9240.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol that generalizes the concept of endpoint properties, which have been tied to IP addresses so far, to entities defined by a wide set of objects.  Further, these properties are presented as maps, similar to the network and cost maps in the base ALTO Protocol.  While supporting the endpoints and related Endpoint Property Service defined in RFC 7285, the ALTO Protocol is extended in two major directions.  First, from endpoints restricted to IP addresses to entities covering a wider and extensible set of objects; second, from properties for specific endpoints to entire entity property maps.  These extensions introduce additional features that allow entities and property values to be specific to a given information resource.  This is made possible by a generic and flexible design of entity and property types."];
