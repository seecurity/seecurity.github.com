Service Registration Protocol for DNS-
Based Service Discovery
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9665.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Service Registration Protocol (SRP) for DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) uses the standard DNS Update mechanism to enable DNS-SD using only unicast packets.  This makes it possible to deploy DNS-SD without multicast, which greatly improves scalability and improves performance on networks where multicast service is not an optimal choice, particularly IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) and IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  DNS-SD Service registration uses public keys and SIG(0) to allow services to defend their registrations."];
