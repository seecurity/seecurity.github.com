Filtering is a mechanism for defining the preferred notification information to be delivered and for specifying triggers that cause that information to be delivered.  In order to enable this, a format is needed to enable the subscriber to describe the state changes of a resource that cause notifications to be sent to it and what those notifications are to contain.
