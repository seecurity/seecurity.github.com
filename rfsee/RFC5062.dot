Stream Control Transmission Protocol
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4960.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document obsoletes RFC 2960 and RFC 3309. It describes the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). SCTP is designed to transport Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks, but is capable of broader applications. SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet network such as IP. It offers the following services to its users: -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data, -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size, -- sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages, -- optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association. The design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Threat Analysis for TCP Extensions for
Multipath Operation with Multiple
Addresses
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6181.html", target="_top", tooltip="Multipath TCP (MPTCP for short) describes the extensions proposed for TCP so that endpoints of a given TCP connection can use multiple paths to exchange data.  Such extensions enable the exchange of segments using different source-destination address pairs, resulting in the capability of using multiple paths in a significant number of scenarios.  Some level of multihoming and mobility support can be achieved through these extensions.  However, the support for multiple IP addresses per endpoint may have implications on the security of the resulting MPTCP.  This note includes a threat analysis for MPTCP.
