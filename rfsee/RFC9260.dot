CUBIC for Fast and Long-Distance
Networks
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9438.html", target="_top", tooltip="CUBIC is a standard TCP congestion control algorithm that uses a cubic function instead of a linear congestion window increase function to improve scalability and stability over fast and long-distance networks. CUBIC has been adopted as the default TCP congestion control algorithm by the Linux, Windows, and Apple stacks. This document updates the specification of CUBIC to include algorithmic improvements based on these implementations and recent academic work. Based on the extensive deployment experience with CUBIC, this document also moves the specification to the Standards Track and obsoletes RFC 8312. This document also updates RFC 5681, to allow for CUBIC's occasionally more aggressive sending behavior."];

Zero Checksum for the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9653.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) uses a 32-bit checksum in the common header of each packet to provide some level of data integrity. If another method used by SCTP already provides the same or a higher level of data integrity, computing this checksum does not provide any additional protection but does consume computing resources. This document provides a simple extension allowing SCTP to save these computing resources by using zero as the checksum in a backwards-compatible way. It also defines how this feature can be used when SCTP packets are encapsulated in Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) packets."];

Benchmarking Methodology for Stateful
NATxy Gateways
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9693.html", target="_top", tooltip="RFC 2544 defines a benchmarking methodology for network interconnect devices.  RFC 5180 addresses IPv6 specificities, and it also provides a technology update but excludes IPv6 transition technologies.  RFC 8219 addresses IPv6 transition technologies, including stateful NAT64.  However, none of them discuss how to apply pseudorandom port numbers from RFC 4814 to any stateful NATxy (such as NAT44, NAT64, and NAT66) technologies.  This document discusses why using pseudorandom port numbers with stateful NATxy gateways is a difficult problem.  It recommends a solution that limits the port number ranges and uses two test phases (phase 1 and phase 2).  This document shows how the classic performance measurement procedures (e.g., throughput, frame loss rate, latency, etc.) can be carried out.  New performance metrics and measurement procedures are also defined for measuring the maximum connection establishment rate, connection tear-down rate, and connection tracking table capacity."];
