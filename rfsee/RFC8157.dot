Huawei's GRE Tunnel Bonding Protocol
2017", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="There is an emerging demand for solutions that provide redundancy and load-sharing across wired and cellular links from a single Service Provider, so that a single subscriber is provided with bonded access to heterogeneous connections at the same time. In this document, GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) Tunnel Bonding is specified as an enabling approach for bonded access to a wired and a wireless network in customer premises, e.g., homes. In GRE Tunnel Bonding, two GRE tunnels, one per network connection, are set up and bonded together to form a single GRE tunnel for a subscriber. Compared with each subconnection, the bonded connections promise increased access capacity and improved reliability. The solution described in this document is currently implemented by Huawei and deployed by Deutsche Telekom AG. This document will enable other developers to build interoperable implementations."];

DHCPv6 Failover Requirements
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7031.html", target="_top", tooltip="The DHCPv6 protocol, defined in RFC 3315, allows for multiple servers to operate on a single network; however, it does not define any way the servers could share information about currently active clients and their leases.  Some sites are interested in running multiple servers in such a way as to provide increased availability in case of server failure.  In order for this to work reliably, the cooperating primary and secondary servers must maintain a consistent database of the lease information.  RFC 3315 allows for, but does not define, any redundancy or failover mechanisms.  This document outlines requirements for DHCPv6 failover, enumerates related problems, and discusses the proposed scope of work to be conducted.

Protocol for Access Node Control
Mechanism in Broadband Networks
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6320.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP). ANCP operates between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node (e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)) in a multi-service reference architecture in order to perform operations related to Quality of Service, service, and subscribers. Use cases for ANCP are documented in RFC 5851. As well as describing the base ANCP protocol, this document specifies capabilities for Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) topology discovery, line configuration, and remote line connectivity testing. The design of ANCP allows for protocol extensions in other documents if they are needed to support other use cases and other access technologies. ANCP is based on the General Switch Management Protocol version 3 (GSMPv3) described in RFC 3292, but with many modifications and extensions, to the point that the two protocols are not interoperable. For this reason, ANCP was assigned a separate version number to distinguish it. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
