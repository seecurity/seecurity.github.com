Cryptographic Protection of TCP Streams

Tcpcrypt coexists with middleboxes by tolerating resegmentation, NATs, and other manipulations of the TCP header.  The protocol is self-contained and specifically tailored to TCP implementations, which often reside in kernels or other environments in which large external software dependencies can be undesirable.  Because the size of TCP options is limited, the protocol requires one additional one-way message latency to perform key exchange before application data can be transmitted.  However, the extra latency can be avoided between two hosts that have recently established a previous tcpcrypt connection."];

HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric KEM, key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) encryption function. Some authenticated variants may not be supported by all KEMs. We provide instantiations of the scheme using widely used and efficient primitives, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF), and SHA2.
