Multipath TCP (MPTCP) Application
Interface Considerations
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Multipath TCP (MPTCP) adds the capability of using multiple paths to a regular TCP session.  Even though it is designed to be totally backward compatible to applications, the data transport differs compared to regular TCP, and there are several additional degrees of freedom that applications may wish to exploit.  This document summarizes the impact that MPTCP may have on applications, such as changes in performance.  Furthermore, it discusses compatibility issues of MPTCP in combination with non-MPTCP-aware applications.  Finally, the document describes a basic application interface that is a simple extension of TCP's interface for MPTCP-aware applications.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

This roadmap provides a brief summary of the documents defining TCP and various TCP extensions that have accumulated in the RFC series.

Services Provided by IETF Transport

It examines the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Multipath TCP, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), UDP-Lite, the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP), File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport / Asynchronous Layered Coding (FLUTE/ALC) for Reliable Multicast, NACK- Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM), Transport Layer Security (TLS), Datagram TLS (DTLS), and the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP), when HTTP is used as a pseudotransport.

On the Usage of Transport Features

TCP Extensions for Multipath Operation
with Multiple Addresses
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8684.html", target="_top", tooltip="TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers. The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and thus improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure. Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., a reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths. This document specifies v1 of Multipath TCP, obsoleting v0 as specified in RFC 6824, through clarifications and modifications primarily driven by deployment experience."];
