An Extensible Message Format for

This content-type is intended as a machine-processable replacement for the various types of delivery status notifications currently used in Internet electronic mail.  Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the so-called Local Area Network (LAN)-based systems), the Delivery Status Notification (DSN) protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of foreign addresses and error codes, in addition to those normally used in Internet mail.  Additional attributes may also be defined to support tunneling of foreign notifications through Internet mail.

This content type is intended to be machine processable.

The purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary LAN-based systems, and are often referred to as read receipts, acknowledgements, or receipt notifications. The intention is to do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past. Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary LAN-based systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a multiprotocol messaging environment.
