The Reason Header Field for the Session

The problem is that network topology may have one or more SIP proxies between the UA and the registrar, such that any request traveling from the user's home network to the registered UA must traverse these proxies.  The REGISTER method does not give us a mechanism to discover and record this sequence of proxies in the registrar for future use.
