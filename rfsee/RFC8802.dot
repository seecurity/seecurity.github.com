The Quality for Service (Q4S) Protocol
2020", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This memo describes an application-level protocol for the communication of end-to-end QoS compliance information based on the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Session Description Protocol (SDP). The Quality for Service (Q4S) protocol provides a mechanism to negotiate and monitor latency, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss, and to alert whenever one of the negotiated conditions is violated. Implementation details on the actions to be triggered upon reception/detection of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol are out of scope of this document; it is either application dependent (e.g., act to increase quality or reduce bit-rate) or network dependent (e.g., change connection's quality profile). This protocol specification is the product of research conducted over a number of years; it is presented here as a permanent record and to offer a foundation for future similar work. It does not represent a standard protocol and does not have IETF consensus."];

RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time
Applications
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3550.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

HighSpeed TCP for Large Congestion
Windows
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3649.html", target="_top", tooltip="The proposals in this document are experimental.  While they may be deployed in the current Internet, they do not represent a consensus that this is the best method for high-speed congestion control.  In particular, we note that alternative experimental proposals are likely to be forthcoming, and it is not well understood how the proposals in this document will interact with such alternative proposals.  This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP's congestion control mechanism for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows.  The congestion control mechanisms of the current Standard TCP constrains the congestion windows that can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments.  For example, for a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packets and a 100 ms round-trip time, achieving a steady-state throughput of 10 Gbps would require an average congestion window of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at most one congestion event every 5,000,000,000 packets (or equivalently, at most one congestion event every 1 2/3 hours).  This is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint.  To address his limitation of TCP, this document proposes HighSpeed TCP, and solicits experimentation and feedback from the wider community."];
