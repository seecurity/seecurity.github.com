Issues with IP Address Sharing

Several possible solutions to this problem are now emerging based around the idea of shared IPv4 addressing. These solutions give rise to a number of issues, and this memo identifies those common to all such address sharing approaches. Such issues include application failures, additional service monitoring complexity, new security vulnerabilities, and so on. Solution-specific discussions are out of scope. Deploying IPv6 is the only perennial way to ease pressure on the public IPv4 address pool without the need for address sharing mechanisms that give rise to the issues identified herein.

Application-Layer Traffic Optimization

ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol. Before an ALTO client can ask for guidance, it needs to discover one or more ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance. In some deployment scenarios, in particular if the information about the network topology is partitioned and distributed over several ALTO servers, it may be necessary to discover an ALTO server outside of the ALTO client's own network domain, in order to get appropriate guidance. This document details applicable scenarios, itemizes requirements, and specifies a procedure for ALTO cross-domain server discovery. Technically, the procedure specified in this document takes one IP address or prefix and a U-NAPTR Service Parameter (typically, ALTO:https) as parameters. It performs DNS lookups (for NAPTR resource records in the in-addr.arpa. or ip6.arpa. trees) and returns one or more URIs of information resources related to that IP address or prefix."];
