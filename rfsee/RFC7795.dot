Pseudowire Redundancy
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6718.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a framework comprised of a number of scenarios and associated requirements for pseudowire (PW) redundancy.  A set of redundant PWs is configured between provider edge (PE) nodes in single-segment PW applications or between terminating PE (T-PE) nodes in multi-segment PW applications.  In order for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW to use for forwarding PW packets to one another, a new PW status is required to indicate the preferential forwarding status of active or standby for each PW in the redundant set.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Pseudowire Preferential Forwarding
Status Bit

A set of Redundant PWs is configured between Provider Edge (PE) nodes in single-segment pseudowire (SS-PW) applications or between Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE) nodes in Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) applications. In order for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW to use for forwarding PW packets to one another, a new status bit is defined. This bit indicates a Preferential Forwarding status with a value of active or standby for each PW in a redundant set. In addition, a second status bit is defined to allow peer PE nodes to coordinate a switchover operation of the PW. Finally, this document updates RFC 4447 by adding details to the handling of the PW status code bits in the PW Status TLV."];

Pseudowire Status for Static Pseudowires

Such a mechanism is suitable for use where no PW dynamic control plane exits, known as static PWs, or where a Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE) needs to send a PW status message directly to a far-end T-PE.  The mechanism allows PW Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) message mapping and PW redundancy to operate on static PWs.  This document also updates RFC 5885 in the case when Bi-directional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is used to convey PW status-signaling information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
