The IETF Standards for Internationalized Domain Names, known as IDNA, focuses on access to domain names in a range of scripts that is broader in scope than the original ASCII.  The development process made it clear that use of characters with similar appearances and/or interpretations created potential for confusion, as well as difficulties in deployment and transition.  The conclusion was that, while those issues were important, they could best be addressed administratively rather than through restrictions embedded in the protocols.
