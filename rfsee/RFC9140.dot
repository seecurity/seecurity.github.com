Nimble Out-of-Band Authentication for

This document defines the EAP-NOOB authentication method for nimble out-of-band (OOB) authentication and key derivation.

The method makes use of a user-assisted, one-directional, out-of-band (OOB) message between the peer device and authentication server to authenticate the in-band key exchange.  The device must have a nonnetwork input or output interface, such as a display, microphone, speaker, or blinking light, that can send or receive dynamically generated messages of tens of bytes in length.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
