Survivability is critical for the delivery of guaranteed network services, such as those subject to strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that place maximum bounds on the length of time that services may be degraded or unavailable. The Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) is a packet-based transport technology based on the MPLS data plane that reuses many aspects of the MPLS management and control planes. This document comprises a framework for the provision of survivability in an MPLS-TP network; it describes recovery elements, types, methods, and topological considerations. To enable data-plane recovery, survivability may be supported by the control plane, management plane, and by Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions.

A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called segments. A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service based.

SR provides a mechanism that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological path, while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SR domain. SR can be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change to the forwarding plane. A segment is encoded as an MPLS label. An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels. The segment to process is on the top of the stack. Upon completion of a segment, the related label is popped from the stack. SR can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header. A segment is encoded as an IPv6 address. An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing header. The active segment is indicated by the Destination Address (DA) of the packet.

The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.

This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called PIE (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value.

Framework of Operations, Administration,

This document's primary purpose is to detail the specific requirements of the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) recommended to maintain a deterministic network.  The document will be used in future work that defines the applicability of and extension of OAM protocols for a deterministic network.  With the implementation of the OAM framework in DetNet, an operator will have a real-time view of the network infrastructure regarding the network's ability to respect the Service Level Objective (SLO), such as packet delay, delay variation, and packet-loss ratio, assigned to each DetNet flow."];

NRP-based enhanced VPNs leverage the VPN and Traffic Engineering (TE) technologies and add characteristics that specific services require beyond those provided by conventional VPNs.  Typically, an NRP-based enhanced VPN will be used to underpin network slicing, but it could also be of use in its own right providing enhanced connectivity services between customer sites.
