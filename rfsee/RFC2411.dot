Security Mechanisms for the Internet

Many security problems can be traced to improper implementations.  However, even a proper implementation will have security problems if the fundamental protocol is itself exploitable.  Exactly how security should be implemented in a protocol will vary, because of the structure of the protocol itself.  However, there are many protocols for which standard Internet security mechanisms, already developed, may be applicable.  The precise one that is appropriate in any given situation can vary.  We review a number of different choices, explaining the properties of each."];

First, it describes the security threats in the context of PPVPNs and defensive techniques to combat those threats.  It considers security issues deriving both from malicious behavior of anyone and from negligent or incorrect behavior of the providers.  It also describes how these security attacks should be detected and reported.  It then discusses possible user requirements for security of a PPVPN service.  These user requirements translate into corresponding provider requirements.  In addition, the provider may have additional requirements to make its network infrastructure secure to a level that can meet the PPVPN customer's expectations.  Finally, this document defines a template that may be used to describe and analyze the security characteristics of a specific PPVPN technology.

The Hello message has been extended for use in Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks for state recovery of control channel or nodal faults. The GMPLS protocol definitions for RSVP also allow a restarting node to learn which label it previously allocated for use on a Label Switched Path (LSP). Further RSVP protocol extensions have been defined to enable a restarting node to recover full control plane state by exchanging RSVP messages with its upstream and downstream neighbors. This document provides an informational clarification of the control plane procedures for a GMPLS network when there are multiple node failures, and describes how full control plane state can be recovered in different scenarios where the order in which the nodes restart is different.
