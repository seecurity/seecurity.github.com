Label Switched Paths (LSP) Hierarchy

A way to create such a hierarchy is by (a) a Label Switching Router (LSR) creating a Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP), (b) the LSR forming a forwarding adjacency (FA) out of that LSP (by advertising this LSP as a Traffic Engineering (TE) link into the same instance of ISIS/OSPF as the one that was used to create the LSP), (c) allowing other LSRs to use FAs for their path computation, and (d) nesting of LSPs originated by other LSRs into that LSP (by using the label stack construct). This document describes the mechanisms to accomplish this. [PROPOSED STANDARD]"];

Furthermore, the management of TE links is not restricted to in-band messaging, but instead can be done using out-of-band techniques.  This document specifies a link management protocol (LMP) that runs between a pair of nodes and is used to manage TE links.  Specifically, LMP will be used to maintain control channel connectivity, verify the physical connectivity of the data links, correlate the link property information, suppress downstream alarms, and localize link failures for protection/restoration purposes in multiple kinds of networks.
