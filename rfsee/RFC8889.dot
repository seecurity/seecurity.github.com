Multipoint Alternate-Marking Method for

Monitoring
2020", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Alternate-Marking method, as presented in RFC 8321, can only be applied to point-to-point flows, because it assumes that all the packets of the flow measured on one node are measured again by a single second node.  This document generalizes and expands this methodology to measure any kind of unicast flow whose packets can follow several different paths in the network -- in wider terms, a multipoint-to-multipoint network.  For this reason, the technique here described is called Multipoint Alternate Marking."];
