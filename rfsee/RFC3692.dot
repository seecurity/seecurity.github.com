2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9756.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document updates the registration procedure within the IANA Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers registry group. This specification changes some of the registries with Standards Action to IETF Review as defined in RFC 8126 and thus updates RFCs 8231, 8233, 8281, 8623, 8664, 8685, 8697, 8733, 8745, 8779, 8780, 8800, 8934, 9050, 9059, 9168, 9357, 9504, 9603, and 9604. Designating experimental use sub-ranges within codepoint registries is often beneficial for protocol experimentation in controlled environments. Although the registries for PCEP messages, objects, and TLV types have sub-ranges assigned for Experimental Use, the registry for PCEP Error-Types and Error-values currently does not. This document updates RFC 5440 by designating a specific range of PCEP Error-Types for Experimental Use."];

Extensions to the YANG Data Model for

This document specifies a set of extensions that fix many of the limitations of the ACL model as initially defined in RFC 8519.
