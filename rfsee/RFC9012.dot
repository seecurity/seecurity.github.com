The document introduces a new BGP address family called the Service Function Chain (SFC) Address Family Identifier / Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SFC AFI/SAFI) with two Route Types. One Route Type is originated by a node to advertise that it hosts a particular instance of a specified service function. This Route Type also provides instructions on how to send a packet to the hosting node in a way that indicates that the service function has to be applied to the packet. The other Route Type is used by a controller to advertise the paths of chains of service functions and give a unique designator to each such path so that they can be used in conjunction with the Network Service Header (NSH) defined in RFC 8300. This document adopts the service function chaining architecture described in RFC 7665."];

Gateway Auto-Discovery and Route
Advertisement for Site Interconnection
Using Segment Routing
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9125.html", target="_top", tooltip="Data centers are attached to the Internet or a backbone network by gateway routers. One data center typically has more than one gateway for commercial, load-balancing, and resiliency reasons. Other sites, such as access networks, also need to be connected across backbone networks through gateways. This document defines a mechanism using the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation attribute to allow data center gateway routers to advertise routes to the prefixes reachable in the site, including advertising them on behalf of other gateways at the same site. This allows segment routing to be used to identify multiple paths across the Internet or backbone network between different gateways. The paths can be selected for load-balancing, resilience, and quality purposes."];

IS-IS Flood Reflection
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9377.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a backward-compatible, optional IS-IS extension that allows the creation of IS-IS flood reflection topologies.  Flood reflection permits topologies in which IS-IS Level 1 (L1) areas provide transit-forwarding for IS-IS Level 2 (L2) areas using all available L1 nodes internally.  It accomplishes this by creating L2 flood reflection adjacencies within each L1 area.  Those adjacencies are used to flood L2 Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) and are used in the L2 Shortest Path First (SPF) computation.  However, they are not ordinarily utilized for forwarding within the flood reflection cluster.  This arrangement gives the L2 topology significantly better scaling properties than prevalently used flat designs.  As an additional benefit, only those routers directly participating in flood reflection are required to support the feature.  This allows for incremental deployment of scalable L1 transit areas in an existing, previously flat network design, without the necessity of upgrading all routers in the network."];

EVPN is a scalable solution for NVO3 networks and keeps the independence of the underlay IP Fabric, i.e., there is no need to enable Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) in the underlay network and maintain multicast states for tenant Broadcast Domains.

Use Cases for a PCE as a Central
Controller (PCECC)
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9689.html", target="_top", tooltip="The PCE is a core component of a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) system. It can be used to compute optimal paths for network traffic and update existing paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic demands. The PCE was developed to derive Traffic Engineering (TE) paths in MPLS networks, which are supplied to the headend of the paths using the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP). SDN has much broader applicability than signalled MPLS TE networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range of use cases including static Label-Switched Paths (LSPs), Segment Routing (SR), Service Function Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller. A PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN without necessarily completely replacing it. This document describes general considerations for PCECC deployment and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges and limitations, through a number of use cases. PCEP extensions, which are required for the PCECC use cases, are covered in separate documents."];

BGP Colored Prefix Routing (CPR) for
Services Based on Segment Routing over
IPv6 (SRv6)
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9723.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism to advertise IPv6 prefixes in BGP that are associated with Color Extended Communities to establish end-to-end intent-aware paths for Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) services. Such IPv6 prefixes are called Colored Prefixes, and this mechanism is called Colored Prefix Routing (CPR). In SRv6 networks, the Colored Prefixes are the SRv6 locators associated with different intents. SRv6 services (e.g., SRv6 VPN services) with a specific intent could be assigned with SRv6 Segment Identifiers (SIDs) under the corresponding SRv6 locators, which are advertised as Colored Prefixes. This operational methodology allows the SRv6 service traffic to be steered into end-to-end intent-aware paths based on the longest prefix matching of SRv6 Service SIDs to the Colored Prefixes. The existing IPv6 Address Family and Color Extended Community are reused to advertise IPv6 Colored Prefixes without new BGP extensions; thus, this mechanism is easy to interoperate and can be deployed incrementally in multi-Autonomous System (AS) networks that belong to the same trusted domain."];

BGP EVPN Multihoming Extensions for
Split-Horizon Filtering
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9746.html", target="_top", tooltip="An Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) is commonly used with Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) tunnels as well as with MPLS and Segment Routing (SR) tunnels. The multihoming procedures in EVPN may vary based on the type of tunnel used within the EVPN Broadcast Domain. Specifically, there are two multihoming split-horizon procedures designed to prevent looped frames on multihomed Customer Edge (CE) devices: the Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) Label-based procedure and the local-bias procedure. The ESI Label-based split-horizon procedure is applied to MPLS-based tunnels such as MPLS over UDP (MPLSoUDP), while the local-bias procedure is used for other tunnels such as Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN) tunnels. Current specifications do not allow operators to choose which split-horizon procedure to use for tunnel encapsulations that support both methods. Examples of tunnels that may support both procedures include MPLSoUDP, MPLS over GRE (MPLSoGRE), Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve), and Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) tunnels. This document updates the EVPN multihoming procedures described in RFCs 7432 and 8365, enabling operators to select the split-horizon procedure that meets their specific requirements."];

BGP Classful Transport Planes
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9832.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a mechanism referred to as Intent-Driven Service Mapping. The mechanism uses BGP to express Intent-based association of overlay routes with underlay routes having specific Traffic Engineering (TE) characteristics satisfying a certain Service Level Agreement (SLA). This is achieved by defining new constructs to group underlay routes with sufficiently similar TE characteristics into identifiable classes (called Transport Classes or TCs), that overlay routes use as an ordered set to resolve reachability (Resolution Schemes) towards service endpoints. These constructs can be used, for example, to realize the IETF Network Slice defined in the TEAS Network Slices framework (RFC 9543). Additionally, this document specifies protocol procedures for BGP that enable dissemination of service mapping information in a network that may span multiple cooperating administrative domains. These domains may be administered either by the same provider or by closely coordinating providers. A new BGP address family that leverages the procedures described in RFC 4364 (BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)) and follows the NLRI encoding described in RFC 8277 (Using BGP to Bind MPLS Labels to Address Prefixes) is defined to enable each advertised underlay route to be identified by its class.
