Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE
(EDHOC)

EDHOC provides mutual authentication, forward secrecy, and identity protection.  EDHOC is intended for usage in constrained scenarios, and a main use case is to establish an Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) security context.  By reusing CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) for cryptography, Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) for encoding, and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for transport, the additional code size can be kept very low."];

Concise Binary Object Representation

These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack. This document obsoletes RFC 7049, providing editorial improvements, new details, and errata fixes while keeping full compatibility with the interchange format of RFC 7049. It does not create a new version of the format."];

CBOR Web Token (CWT)

The claims in a CWT are encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added application-layer security protection.  A claim is a piece of information asserted about a subject and is represented as a name/value pair consisting of a claim name and a claim value.  CWT is derived from JSON Web Token (JWT) but uses CBOR rather than JSON."];
