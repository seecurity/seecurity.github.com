Sieve: An Email Filtering Language

It is designed to be implementable on either a mail client or mail server.  It is meant to be extensible, simple, and independent of access protocol, mail architecture, and operating system.  It is suitable for running on a mail server where users may not be allowed to execute arbitrary programs, such as on black box Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) servers, as the base language has no variables, loops, or ability to shell out to external programs.

Sieve Email Filtering: Reject and
Extended Reject Extensions
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5429.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo updates the definition of the Sieve mail filtering language reject extension, originally defined in RFC 3028. A Joe-job is a spam run forged to appear as though it came from an innocent party, who is then generally flooded by automated bounces, Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs), and personal messages with complaints. The original Sieve reject action defined in RFC 3028 required use of MDNs for rejecting messages, thus contributing to the flood of Joe-job spam to victims of Joe-jobs. This memo updates the definition of the reject action to allow messages to be refused during the SMTP transaction, and defines the ereject action to require messages to be refused during the SMTP transaction, if possible. The ereject action is intended to replace the reject action wherever possible. The ereject action is similar to reject, but will always favor protocol-level message rejection. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
