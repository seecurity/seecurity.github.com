Indication of Conference Focus Support

2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) document (RFC 6503) defines a way for a client to discover a conference control server that supports CCMP. However, it does not define a way for a client involved in a conference to determine if the conference focus supports CCMP. This information would allow a CCMP-enabled client that joins a conference using SIP to also register for the Centralized Conferencing (XCON) conference event package and take advantage of CCMP operations on the conference. This document describes two mechanisms, depending upon the need of the User Agent (UA), to address the above limitation. The first mechanism uses the Call-Info header field, and the second mechanism defines a new value for the purpose header field parameter in the <service-uris> element in the SIP conferencing event package.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
