Parallel NFS (pNFS) Flexible File Layout

Network File System (NFS) Version 4
Protocol

Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4 protocol supports traditional file access while integrating support for file locking and the MOUNT protocol. In addition, support for strong security (and its negotiation), COMPOUND operations, client caching, and internationalization has been added. Of course, attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an Internet environment.

Reporting Errors in NFSv4.2 via

If the client has not encountered errors with the data files, then the state can be recovered and the resilvering of the data files can be avoided.  With any errors, there is no means by which the client can report errors to the MDS.  As such, the MDS has to assume that a file needs resilvering.  This document presents an extension to RFC 8435 to allow the client to update the metadata via LAYOUTRETURN and avoid the resilvering."];
