Cryptographic Protection of TCP Streams
(tcpcrypt)
2019", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies tcpcrypt, a TCP encryption protocol designed for use in conjunction with the TCP Encryption Negotiation Option (TCP-ENO).  Tcpcrypt coexists with middleboxes by tolerating resegmentation, NATs, and other manipulations of the TCP header.  The protocol is self-contained and specifically tailored to TCP implementations, which often reside in kernels or other environments in which large external software dependencies can be undesirable.  Because the size of TCP options is limited, the protocol requires one additional one-way message latency to perform key exchange before application data can be transmitted.  However, the extra latency can be avoided between two hosts that have recently established a previous tcpcrypt connection.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

TCP-ENO: Encryption Negotiation Option
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8547.html", target="_top", tooltip="Despite growing adoption of TLS, a significant fraction of TCP traffic on the Internet remains unencrypted.  The persistence of unencrypted traffic can be attributed to at least two factors.  First, some legacy protocols lack a signaling mechanism (such as a STARTTLS command) by which to convey support for encryption, thus making incremental deployment impossible.  Second, legacy applications themselves cannot always be upgraded and therefore require a way to implement encryption transparently entirely within the transport layer.  The TCP Encryption Negotiation Option (TCP-ENO) addresses both of these problems through a new TCP option kind providing out-of-band, fully backward-compatible negotiation of encryption."];

Randomness Requirements for Security
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4086.html", target="_top", tooltip="Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these systems is dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar quantities. The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can result in pseudo-security. A sophisticated attacker may find it easier to reproduce the environment that produced the secret quantities and to search the resulting small set of possibilities than to locate the quantities in the whole of the potential number space. Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult. This document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for generating such quantities. It recommends the use of truly random hardware techniques and shows that the existing hardware on many systems can be used for this purpose. It provides suggestions to ameliorate the problem when a hardware solution is not available, and it gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for some applications.
