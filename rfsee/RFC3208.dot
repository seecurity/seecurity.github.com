PGM Reliable Transport Protocol
Specification
2001", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) is a reliable multicast transport protocol for applications that require ordered or unordered, duplicate- free, multicast data delivery from multiple sources to multiple receivers.  PGM guarantees that a receiver in the group either receives all data packets from transmissions and repairs, or is able to detect unrecoverable data packet loss.  PGM is specifically intended as a workable solution for multicast applications with basic reliability requirements.  Its central design goal is simplicity of operation with due regard for scalability and network efficiency.

Building Blocks

The rationale for protocol design goals and assumptions are presented.  Technical challenges for NACK-based (and in some cases general) reliable multicast protocol operation are identified.  These goals and challenges are resolved into a set of functional building blocks that address different aspects of reliable multicast protocol operation.  It is anticipated that these building blocks will be useful in generating different instantiations of reliable multicast protocols.  This document obsoletes RFC 3941. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

IP Router Alert Considerations and Usage
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6398.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IP Router Alert Option is an IP option that alerts transit routers to more closely examine the contents of an IP packet.  The Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP), Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM), the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD), Multicast Router Discovery (MRD), and General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) are some of the protocols that make use of the IP Router Alert Option.  This document discusses security aspects and usage guidelines around the use of the current IP Router Alert Option, thereby updating RFC 2113 and RFC 2711.  Specifically, it provides recommendations against using the Router Alert in the end-to-end open Internet and identifies controlled environments where protocols depending on Router Alert can be used safely.  It also provides recommendations about protection approaches for service providers.  Finally, it provides brief guidelines for Router Alert implementation on routers.
