Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Scheme
for the Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP)
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4088.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Internet Standard Management Framework are widely used for the management of communication devices, creating a need to specify SNMP access (including access to SNMP MIB object instances) from non-SNMP management environments. For example, when out-of-band IP management is used via a separate management interface (e.g., for a device that does not support in-band IP access), a uniform way to indicate how to contact the device for management is needed. Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) fit this need well, as they allow a single text string to indicate a management access communication endpoint for a wide variety of IP-based protocols. This document defines a URI scheme so that SNMP can be designated as the protocol used for management. The scheme also allows a URI to designate one or more MIB object instances. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
