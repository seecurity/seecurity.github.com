SIP cause URI Parameter for Service
Number Translation
2017", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="RFC 4458 (regarding SIP URIs for applications) defines a cause URI parameter, which may appear in the Request-URI of a SIP request, that is used to indicate a reason why the request arrived to the User Agent Server (UAS) receiving the message.  This document updates RFC 4458 by creating a new predefined value for the cause URI parameter to cover service number translation for cases of retargeting due to specific service action leading to the translation of a called service access number.  This document also provides guidance, which was missing in RFC 4458, for using the cause URI parameter within the History-Info header field, since this use is mandatory in some IP networks' implementations.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

This capability enables many enhanced services by providing the information as to how and why a SIP request arrives at a specific application or user.  This document defines an optional SIP header field, History-Info, for capturing the history information in requests.  The document also defines SIP header field parameters for the History-Info and Contact header fields to tag the method by which the target of a request is determined.  In addition, this specification defines a value for the Privacy header field that directs the anonymization of values in the History-Info header field.  This document obsoletes RFC 4244."];

Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications:
ABNF

Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The Reason Header Field for the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3326.html", target="_top", tooltip="The REGISTER function is used in a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) system primarily to associate a temporary contact address with an address-of-record.  This contact is generally in the form of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), such as Contact: <sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com> and is generally dynamic and associated with the IP address or hostname of the SIP User Agent (UA).  The problem is that network topology may have one or more SIP proxies between the UA and the registrar, such that any request traveling from the user's home network to the registered UA must traverse these proxies.  The REGISTER method does not give us a mechanism to discover and record this sequence of proxies in the registrar for future use.  This document defines an extension header field, Path which provides such a mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
