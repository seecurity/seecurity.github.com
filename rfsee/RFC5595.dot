The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
(DCCP) Service Codes
2009", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the usage of Service Codes by the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol, RFC 4340.

This provides improved flexibility in the use and assignment of port numbers for connection multiplexing.  The use of a DCCP Service Code can also enable more explicit coordination of services with middleboxes (e.g., network address translators and firewalls).

It offers the following services to its users: -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data, -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size, -- sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages, -- optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association. The design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
