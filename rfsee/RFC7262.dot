A Framework for Conferencing with the
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4353.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the initiation, modification, and termination of media sessions between user agents.  These sessions are managed by SIP dialogs, which represent a SIP relationship between a pair of user agents.  Because dialogs are between pairs of user agents, SIP's usage for two-party communications (such as a phone call), is obvious.  Communications sessions with multiple participants, generally known as conferencing, are more complicated.  This document defines a framework for how such conferencing can occur.  This framework describes the overall architecture, terminology, and protocol components needed for multi-party conferencing.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Call

This document builds on the Conferencing Requirements and Framework documents to define how a tightly coupled SIP conference works.  The approach is explored from the perspective of different user agent (UA) types: conference-unaware, conference-aware, and focus UAs.  The use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in conferencing, OPTIONS for capabilities discovery, and call control using REFER are covered in detail with example call flow diagrams.  The usage of the isfocus feature tag is defined.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];

Use Cases for Telepresence Multistreams
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7205.html", target="_top", tooltip="Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create an environment that gives users (or user groups) that are not co-located a feeling of co-located presence through multimedia communication that includes at least audio and video signals of high fidelity.  A number of techniques for handling audio and video streams are used to create this experience.  When these techniques are not similar, interoperability between different systems is difficult at best, and often not possible.  Conveying information about the relationships between multiple streams of media would enable senders and receivers to make choices to allow telepresence systems to interwork.  This memo describes the most typical and important use cases for sending multiple streams in a telepresence conference."];

The framework also outlines a set of conferencing protocols, which are complementary to the call signaling protocols, for building advanced conferencing applications.
