A Proposed Media Delivery Index (MDI)
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This memo defines a Media Delivery Index (MDI) measurement that can be used as a diagnostic tool or a quality indicator for monitoring a network intended to deliver applications such as streaming media, MPEG video, Voice over IP, or other information sensitive to arrival time and packet loss.  It provides an indication of traffic jitter, a measure of deviation from nominal flow rates, and a data loss at-a-glance measure for a particular flow.  For instance, the MDI may be used as a reference in characterizing and comparing networks carrying UDP streaming media.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Considerations for Selecting RTP Control
Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR)
Metrics for the WebRTC Statistics API
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8451.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes monitoring features related to media streams in Web real-time communication (WebRTC).  It provides a list of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Sender Report (SR), Receiver Report (RR), and Extended Report (XR) metrics, which may need to be supported by RTP implementations in some diverse environments.  It lists a set of identifiers for the WebRTC's statistics API.  These identifiers are a set of RTCP SR, RR, and XR metrics related to the transport of multimedia flows."];
