Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4068.html", target="_top", tooltip="Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node to maintain its connectivity to the Internet when moving from one Access Router to another, a process referred to as handover.  During handover, there is a period during which the Mobile Node is unable to send or receive packets because of link switching delay and IP protocol operations.  This handover latency resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures, namely movement detection, new Care of Address configuration, and Binding Update, is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP.  Reducing the handover latency could be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as well.  This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures.  This document does not address improving the link switching latency.

Mobile IPv4 Challenge/Response
Extensions (Revised)
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4721.html", target="_top", tooltip="Mobile IP, as originally specified, defines an authentication extension (the Mobile-Foreign Authentication extension) by which a mobile node can authenticate itself to a foreign agent. Unfortunately, that extension does not provide the foreign agent any direct guarantee that the protocol is protected from replays and does not allow for the use of existing techniques (such as Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)) for authenticating portable computer devices. In this specification, we define extensions for the Mobile IP Agent Advertisements and the Registration Request that allow a foreign agent to use a challenge/response mechanism to authenticate the mobile node. Furthermore, this document updates RFC 3344 by including a new authentication extension called the Mobile-Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Authentication extension. This new extension is provided so that a mobile node can supply credentials for authorization, using commonly available AAA infrastructure elements. This authorization-enabling extension MAY co-exist in the same Registration Request with authentication extensions defined for Mobile IP Registration by RFC 3344. This document obsoletes RFC 3012.

Mobile IP for IPv4 requires strong authentication between the mobile node and its home agent.  When the mobile node shares an AAA Security Association with its home AAA server, however, it is possible to use that AAA Security Association to create derived Mobility Security Associations between the mobile node and its home agent, and again between the mobile node and the foreign agent currently offering connectivity to the mobile node.  This document specifies extensions to Mobile IP registration messages that can be used to create Mobility Security Associations between the mobile node and its home agent, and/or between the mobile node and a foreign agent.

Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5949.html", target="_top", tooltip="Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6; RFC 3775) provides a mobile node with IP mobility when it performs a handover from one access router to another, and fast handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) are specified to enhance the handover performance in terms of latency and packet loss. While MIPv6 (and FMIPv6 as well) requires the participation of the mobile node in the mobility-related signaling, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6; RFC 5213) provides IP mobility to nodes that either have or do not have MIPv6 functionality without such involvement. Nevertheless, the basic performance of PMIPv6 in terms of handover latency and packet loss is considered no different from that of MIPv6. When the fast handover is considered in such an environment, several modifications are needed to FMIPv6 to adapt to the network-based mobility management. This document specifies the usage of fast handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6; RFC 5568) when Proxy Mobile IPv6 is used as the mobility management protocol. Necessary extensions are specified for FMIPv6 to support the scenario when the mobile node does not have IP mobility functionality and hence is not involved with either MIPv6 or FMIPv6 operations.
