As a consequence, the role of Ethernet is rapidly expanding into transport networks that previously were the domain of other technologies such as Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).  This document defines an architecture and framework for a Generalized- MPLS-based control plane for Ethernet in this transport network capacity.  GMPLS has already been specified for similar technologies.  Some additional extensions to the GMPLS control plane are needed, and this document provides a framework for these extensions.

This document describes the architecture of GMPLS. GMPLS extends MPLS to encompass time-division (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, G.709), wavelength (lambdas), and spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber). The focus of GMPLS is on the control plane of these various layers since each of them can use physically diverse data or forwarding planes. The intention is to cover both the signaling and the routing part of that control plane. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
