Use Cases for Telepresence Multistreams
2014", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create an environment that gives users (or user groups) that are not co-located a feeling of co-located presence through multimedia communication that includes at least audio and video signals of high fidelity.  A number of techniques for handling audio and video streams are used to create this experience.  When these techniques are not similar, interoperability between different systems is difficult at best, and often not possible.  Conveying information about the relationships between multiple streams of media would enable senders and receivers to make choices to allow telepresence systems to interwork.  This memo describes the most typical and important use cases for sending multiple streams in a telepresence conference."];

RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time
Applications
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3550.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.
