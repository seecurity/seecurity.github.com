The NSA (No Secrecy Afforded)
Certificate Extension

Historically, clients and servers strived to maintain the privacy of their keys; however, the secrecy of their private keys cannot always be maintained.  In certain circumstances, a client or a server might feel that they will be compelled in the future to share their keys with a third party.  Some clients and servers also have been compelled to share their keys and wish to indicate to relying parties upon certificate renewal that their keys have in fact been shared with a third party.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Standard certificate extensions are described and two Internet-specific extensions are defined.  A set of required certificate extensions is specified.  The X.509 v2 CRL format is described in detail along with standard and Internet-specific extensions.  An algorithm for X.509 certification path validation is described.
