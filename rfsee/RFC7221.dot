Handling of Internet-Drafts by IETF
Working Groups

When a working group is ready to develop a particular document, the most common mechanism is for it to adopt an existing document as a starting point.  The document that a working group adopts and then develops further is based on initial input at varying levels of maturity.  An initial working group draft might be a document already in wide use, or it might be a blank sheet, wholly created by the working group, or it might represent any level of maturity in between.  This document discusses how a working group typically handles the formal documents that it targets for publication.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Promoting Compliance with Intellectual

However, this process is not always followed by IETF participants.  Regardless of the cause or motivation, noncompliance with IPR disclosure rules can delay or even derail completion of IETF specifications.  This document describes some strategies for promoting compliance with the IPR disclosure rules.  These strategies are primarily intended for use by area directors, working group chairs, and working group secretaries.
