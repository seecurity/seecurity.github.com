The 'tag' URI Scheme
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the tag Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme.  Tag URIs (also known as tags) are designed to be unique across space and time while being tractable to humans.  They are distinct from most other URIs in that they have no authoritative resolution mechanism.  A tag may be used purely as an entity identifier.  Furthermore, using tags has some advantages over the common practice of using http URIs as identifiers for non-HTTP-accessible resources.

Sieve Extension: Externally Stored Lists
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6134.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Sieve email filtering language can be used to implement email whitelisting, blacklisting, personal distribution lists, and other sorts of list matching. Currently, this requires that all members of such lists be hard-coded in the script itself. Whenever a member of a list is added or deleted, the script needs to be updated and possibly uploaded to a mail server. This document defines a Sieve extension for accessing externally stored lists -- lists whose members are stored externally to the script, such as using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), the Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP), vCard Extensions to WebDAV (CardDAV), or relational databases.

Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)

Representations are defined in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), Extensible Markup Language (XML), and Efficient XML Interchange (EXI), which share the common SenML data model.  A simple sensor, such as a temperature sensor, could use one of these media types in protocols such as HTTP or the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to transport the measurements of the sensor or to be configured."];

Arm's Platform Security Architecture
(PSA) Attestation Token
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9783.html", target="_top", tooltip="Arm's Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is a family of hardware and firmware security specifications, along with open-source reference implementations, aimed at helping device makers and chip manufacturers integrate best-practice security into their products. Devices that comply with PSA can generate attestation tokens as described in this document, which serve as the foundation for various protocols, including secure provisioning and network access control. This document specifies the structure and semantics of the PSA attestation token. The PSA attestation token is a profile of the Entity Attestation Token (EAT). This specification describes the claims used in an attestation token generated by PSA-compliant systems, how these claims are serialized for transmission, and how they are cryptographically protected. This Informational document is published as an Independent Submission to improve interoperability with Arm's architecture. It is not a standard nor a product of the IETF."];
