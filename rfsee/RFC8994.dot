GRASP depends on an external security environment that is described elsewhere.  The technical objectives and parameters for specific application scenarios are to be described in separate documents.  Appendices briefly discuss requirements for the protocol and existing protocols with comparable features."];

GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol
Application Program Interface (GRASP
API)

Such an API is needed for Autonomic Service Agents (ASAs) calling the GRASP protocol module to exchange Autonomic Network messages with other ASAs.  Since GRASP is designed to support asynchronous operations, the API will need to be adapted according to the support for asynchronicity in various programming languages and operating systems."];

Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
Infrastructure (BRSKI)
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8995.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic Control Plane.  To do this, a Secure Key Infrastructure is bootstrapped.  This is done using manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing service, both online and offline.  We call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol.  Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks.  Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included.  Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well."];

At the same time, terms related to Intent-Based Networking are often used loosely and inconsistently, in many cases overlapping and confused with other concepts such as policy. This document clarifies the concept of intent and provides an overview of the functionality that is associated with it. The goal is to contribute towards a common and shared understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality that can be used as the foundation to guide further definition of associated research and engineering problems and their solutions.

BRSKI with Alternative Enrollment

BRSKI-AE extends BRSKI to support certificate enrollment mechanisms instead of the originally specified use of Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST).  It supports certificate enrollment protocols such as the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) that use authenticated self-contained signed objects for certification messages, allowing for flexibility in network device onboarding scenarios.  The enhancements address use cases where the existing enrollment mechanism may not be feasible or optimal, providing a framework for integrating suitable alternative enrollment protocols.  This document also updates the BRSKI reference architecture to accommodate these alternative methods, ensuring secure and scalable deployment across a range of network environments."];

Clarification and Enhancement of the CSR
Attributes Definition in RFC 7030

RFC 9148 is derived from RFC 7030 and is also updated. RFC 7030 is ambiguous in its specification of the CSR Attributes Response. This has resulted in implementation challenges and implementor confusion because there was no universal understanding of what was specified. This document clarifies the encoding rules. This document also provides a new straightforward approach: using a template for CSR contents that may be partially filled in by the server. This also allows an EST server to specify a subject Distinguished Name (DN)."];
