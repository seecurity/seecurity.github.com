Unicast UDP Usage Guidelines for
Application Designers
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5405.html", target="_top", tooltip="The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms.  Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and upper-layer protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic.  This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of unicast applications and upper-layer protocols.  Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, and middlebox traversal.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];

RTP Stream Pause and Resume

This document extends the Codec Control Message (CCM) RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback package by explicitly allowing and describing specific use of existing CCMs and adding a group of new real-time feedback messages used to pause and resume RTP data streams.

Traversal Using Relays around NAT
(TURN): Relay Extensions to Session
Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8656.html", target="_top", tooltip="If a host is located behind a NAT, it can be impossible for that host to communicate directly with other hosts (peers) in certain situations. In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of an intermediate node that acts as a communication relay. This specification defines a protocol, called Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN), that allows the host to control the operation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using the relay. TURN differs from other relay control protocols in that it allows a client to communicate with multiple peers using a single relay address. The TURN protocol was designed to be used as part of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) approach to NAT traversal, though it can also be used without ICE. This document obsoletes RFCs 5766 and 6156."];
