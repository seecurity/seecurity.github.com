A Set of Possible Requirements for a
Future Routing Architecture
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The requirements for routing architectures described in this document were produced by two sub-groups under the IRTF Routing Research Group (RRG) in 2001, with some editorial updates up to 2006. The two sub- groups worked independently, and the resulting requirements represent two separate views of the problem and of what is required to fix the problem. This document may usefully serve as part of the recommended reading for anyone who works on routing architecture designs for the Internet in the future. The document is published with the support of the IRTF RRG as a record of the work completed at that time, but with the understanding that it does not necessarily represent either the latest technical understanding or the technical consensus of the research group at the date of publication.

Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support
Protocol
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3963.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support protocol that enables Mobile Networks to attach to different points in the Internet.  The protocol is an extension of Mobile IPv6 and allows session continuity for every node in the Mobile Network as the network moves.  It also allows every node in the Mobile Network to be reachable while moving around.  The Mobile Router, which connects the network to the Internet, runs the NEMO Basic Support protocol with its Home Agent.  The protocol is designed so that network mobility is transparent to the nodes inside the Mobile Network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
