Internet Content Adaptation Protocol
(ICAP)
2003", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="ICAP, the Internet Content Adaption Protocol, is a protocol aimed at providing simple object-based content vectoring for HTTP services.  ICAP is, in essence, a lightweight protocol for executing a remote procedure call on HTTP messages.  It allows ICAP clients to pass HTTP messages to ICAP servers for some sort of transformation or other processing (adaptation).  The server executes its transformation service on messages and sends back responses to the client, usually with modified messages.  Typically, the adapted messages are either HTTP requests or HTTP responses.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Comcast's Web Notification System Design
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6108.html", target="_top", tooltip="The objective of this document is to describe a method of providing critical end-user notifications to web browsers, which has been deployed by Comcast, an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  Such a notification system is being used to provide near-immediate notifications to customers, such as to warn them that their traffic exhibits patterns that are indicative of malware or virus infection.  There are other proprietary systems that can perform such notifications, but those systems utilize Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology.  In contrast to DPI, this document describes a system that does not rely upon DPI, and is instead based in open IETF standards and open source applications.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
