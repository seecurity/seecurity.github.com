Implicit Initialization Vector (IV) for

Security Payload (ESP)
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8750.html", target="_top", tooltip="Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) sends an initialization vector (IV) in each packet.  The size of the IV depends on the applied transform and is usually 8 or 16 octets for the transforms defined at the time this document was written.  When used with IPsec, some algorithms, such as AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and ChaCha20-Poly1305, take the IV to generate a nonce that is used as an input parameter for encrypting and decrypting.  This IV must be unique but can be predictable.  As a result, the value provided in the ESP Sequence Number (SN) can be used instead to generate the nonce.  This avoids sending the IV itself and saves 8 octets per packet in the case of AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and ChaCha20-Poly1305.  This document describes how to do this."];

This new payload type can be used for various purposes, such as decreasing encapsulation overhead for small IP packets; however, the focus in this document is to enhance IP Traffic Flow Security (IP-TFS) by adding Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) to encrypted IP-encapsulated traffic.  TFC is provided by obscuring the size and frequency of IP traffic using a fixed-size, constant-send-rate IPsec tunnel.  The solution allows for congestion control, as well as nonconstant send-rate usage."];
