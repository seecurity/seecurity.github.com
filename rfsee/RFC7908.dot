Problem Definition and Classification of
BGP Route Leaks
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="A systemic vulnerability of the Border Gateway Protocol routing system, known as route leaks, has received significant attention in recent years.  Frequent incidents that result in significant disruptions to Internet routing are labeled route leaks, but to date a common definition of the term has been lacking.  This document provides a working definition of route leaks while keeping in mind the real occurrences that have received significant attention.  Further, this document attempts to enumerate (though not exhaustively) different types of route leaks based on observed events on the Internet.  The aim is to provide a taxonomy that covers several forms of route leaks that have been observed and are of concern to the Internet user community as well as the network operator community."];

Route Leak Prevention and Detection
Using Roles in UPDATE and OPEN Messages
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9234.html", target="_top", tooltip="Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes that violate assumptions of BGP topology relationships, e.g., announcing a route learned from one transit provider to another transit provider or a lateral (i.e., non-transit) peer or announcing a route learned from one lateral peer to another lateral peer or a transit provider.  These are usually the result of misconfigured or absent BGP route filtering or lack of coordination between autonomous systems (ASes).  Existing approaches to leak prevention rely on marking routes by operator configuration, with no check that the configuration corresponds to that of the External BGP (eBGP) neighbor, or enforcement of the two eBGP speakers agreeing on the peering relationship.  This document enhances the BGP OPEN message to establish an agreement of the peering relationship on each eBGP session between autonomous systems in order to enforce appropriate configuration on both sides.  Propagated routes are then marked according to the agreed relationship, allowing both prevention and detection of route leaks."];
