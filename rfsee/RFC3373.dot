Three-Way Handshake for IS-IS Point-to-

2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5303.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IS-IS routing protocol (Intermediate System to Intermediate System, ISO 10589) requires reliable protocols at the link layer for point-to-point links. As a result, it does not use a three-way handshake when establishing adjacencies on point-to-point media. This paper defines a backward-compatible extension to the protocol that provides for a three-way handshake. It is fully interoperable with systems that do not support the extension. Additionally, the extension allows the robust operation of more than 256 point-to-point links on a single router. This extension has been implemented by multiple router vendors; this paper is provided to the Internet community in order to allow interoperable implementations to be built by other vendors.
