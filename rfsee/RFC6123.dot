Inclusion of Manageability Sections in
Path Computation Element (PCE) Working
Group Drafts
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="It has often been the case that manageability considerations have been retrofitted to protocols after they have been specified, standardized, implemented, or deployed. This is sub-optimal. Similarly, new protocols or protocol extensions are frequently designed without due consideration of manageability requirements. The Operations Area has developed Guidelines for Considering Operations and Management of New Protocols and Protocol Extensions (RFC 5706), and those guidelines have been adopted by the Path Computation Element (PCE) Working Group. Previously, the PCE Working Group used the recommendations contained in this document to guide authors of Internet-Drafts on the contents of Manageability Considerations sections in their work.

Extensions

Two types of changes are included.  First, several completely new elements are introduced, for example, classes for header filtering, that extend PCIM into areas that it did not previously cover.  Second, there are cases where elements of PCIM (for example, policy rule priorities) are deprecated, and replacement elements are defined (in this case, priorities tied to associations that refer to policy rules).  Both types of changes are done in such a way that, to the extent possible, interoperability with implementations of the original PCIM model is preserved.  This document updates RFC 3060.

Path Computation Element Communication
Protocol (PCEP) Extension for Flow
Specification

These paths may be supplied in response to requests for computation or may be unsolicited requests issued by the PCE to network elements. Both approaches use the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to convey the details of the computed path. Traffic flows may be categorized and described using Flow Specifications. RFC 8955 defines the Flow Specification and describes how Flow Specification components are used to describe traffic flows. RFC 8955 also defines how Flow Specifications may be distributed in BGP to allow specific traffic flows to be associated with routes. This document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support dissemination of Flow Specifications. This allows a PCE to indicate what traffic should be placed on each path that it is aware of. The extensions defined in this document include the creation, update, and withdrawal of Flow Specifications via PCEP and can be applied to tunnels initiated by the PCE or to tunnels where control is delegated to the PCE by the Path Computation Client (PCC). Furthermore, a PCC requesting a new path can include Flow Specifications in the request to indicate the purpose of the tunnel allowing the PCE to factor this into the path computation."];
