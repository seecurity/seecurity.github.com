Guidance for Authentication,
Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Key
Management
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4962.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides guidance to designers of Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) key management protocols.  The guidance is also useful to designers of systems and solutions that include AAA key management protocols.  Given the complexity and difficulty in designing secure, long-lasting key management algorithms and protocols by experts in the field, it is almost certainly inappropriate for IETF working groups without deep expertise in the area to be designing their own key management algorithms and protocols based on Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocols.  The guidelines in this document apply to documents requesting publication as IETF RFCs.  Further, these guidelines will be useful to other standards development organizations (SDOs) that specify AAA key management.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];

Framework and Requirements for an Access
Node Control Mechanism in Broadband
Multi-Service Networks
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5851.html", target="_top", tooltip="The purpose of this document is to define a framework for an Access Node Control Mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node (e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)) in a multi-service reference architecture in order to perform operations related to service, quality of service, and subscribers. The Access Node Control Mechanism will ensure that the transmission of the information does not need to go through distinct element managers but rather uses a direct device-device communication. This allows for performing access-link-related operations within those network elements, while avoiding impact on the existing Operational Support Systems. This document first identifies a number of use cases for which the Access Node Control Mechanism may be appropriate. It then presents the requirements for the Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) that must be taken into account during protocol design. Finally, it describes requirements for the network elements that need to support ANCP and the described use cases. These requirements should be seen as guidelines rather than as absolute requirements. RFC 2119 therefore does not apply to the nodal requirements. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Applicability of the Access Node Control
Mechanism to Broadband Networks Based on
Passive Optical Networks (PONs)
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6934.html", target="_top", tooltip="The purpose of this document is to provide applicability of the Access Node Control Mechanism to broadband access based on Passive Optical Networks (PONs).  The need for an Access Node Control Mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node Complex, composed of a combination of Optical Line Termination (OLT) and Optical Network Termination (ONT) elements, is described in a multi-service reference architecture in order to perform QoS-related, service-related, and subscriber-related operations.  The Access Node Control Mechanism is also extended for interaction between components of the Access Node Complex (OLT and ONT).  The Access Node Control Mechanism will ensure that the transmission of information between the NAS and Access Node Complex (ANX) and between the OLT and ONT within an ANX does not need to go through distinct element managers but rather uses direct device-to-device communication and stays on net.  This allows for performing access-link-related operations within those network elements to meet performance objectives."];
