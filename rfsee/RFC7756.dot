Stateless IP/ICMP Translation for IPv6
Internet Data Center Environments (SIIT-
DC): Dual Translation Mode
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes an extension of the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation for IPv6 Internet Data Center Environments (SIIT-DC) architecture, which allows applications, protocols, or nodes that are incompatible with IPv6 and/or Network Address Translation to operate correctly with SIIT-DC. This is accomplished by introducing a new component called an SIIT-DC Edge Relay, which reverses the translations made by an SIIT-DC Border Relay. The application and/or node is thus provided with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity that provides end-to-end address transparency. The reader is expected to be familiar with the SIIT-DC architecture described in RFC 7755.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

SIIT-DC: Stateless IP/ICMP Translation
for IPv6 Data Center Environments

In this deployment model, traffic from legacy IPv4-only clients on the Internet is translated to IPv6 upon reaching the IDC operator's network infrastructure.

This facilitates a single-stack IPv6-only network infrastructure, as well as efficient utilization of public IPv4 addresses.

Default Address Selection for Internet

The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior. In dual-stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses -- depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice versa.
