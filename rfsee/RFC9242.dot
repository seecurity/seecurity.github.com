Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2
(IKEv2) Session Resumption
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5723.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certain computational and communication overhead with respect to the number of round trips required and the cryptographic operations involved. In remote access situations, the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used for authentication, which adds several more round trips and consequently latency. To re-establish security associations (SAs) upon a failure recovery condition is time consuming especially when an IPsec peer (such as a VPN gateway) needs to re-establish a large number of SAs with various endpoints. A high number of concurrent sessions might cause additional problems for an IPsec peer during SA re-establishment. In order to avoid the need to re-run the key exchange protocol from scratch, it would be useful to provide an efficient way to resume an IKE/IPsec session. This document proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly efficient manner, utilizing a previously established IKE SA. A client can reconnect to a gateway from which it was disconnected. The proposed approach encodes partial IKE state into an opaque ticket, which can be stored on the client or in a centralized store, and is later made available to the IKEv2 responder for re-authentication. We use the term ticket to refer to the opaque data that is created by the IKEv2 responder. This document does not specify the format of the ticket but examples are provided. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Multiple Key Exchanges in the Internet

This document utilizes the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchange, where multiple key exchanges are performed when an IKE SA is being established. It also introduces a new IKEv2 exchange, IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE, which is used for the same purpose when the IKE SA is being rekeyed or is creating additional Child SAs. This document updates RFC 7296 by renaming a Transform Type 4 from Diffie-Hellman Group (D-H) to Key Exchange Method (KE) and renaming a field in the Key Exchange Payload from Diffie-Hellman Group Num to Key Exchange Method. It also renames an IANA registry for this Transform Type from Transform Type 4 - Diffie- Hellman Group Transform IDs to Transform Type 4 - Key Exchange Method Transform IDs.

Mixing Preshared Keys in the

Exchanges of the Internet Key Exchange
Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) for Post-
Quantum Security
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9867.html", target="_top", tooltip="An Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) extension defined in RFC 8784 allows IPsec traffic to be protected against someone storing VPN communications and decrypting them later, when (and if) a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) is available. The protection is achieved by means of a Post-quantum Preshared Key (PPK) that is mixed into the session keys calculation. However, this protection does not cover an initial IKEv2 Security Association (SA), which might be unacceptable in some scenarios. This specification defines an alternative way to provide protection against quantum computers, which is similar to the solution defined in RFC 8784, but it also protects the initial IKEv2 SA. RFC 8784 assumes that PPKs are static and thus they are only used when an initial IKEv2 SA is created. If a fresh PPK is available before the IKE SA expires, then the only way to use it is to delete the current IKE SA and create a new one from scratch, which is inefficient. This specification defines a way to use PPKs in active IKEv2 SAs for creating additional IPsec SAs and rekey operations."];
