PCMAIL: A distributed mail system for
personal computers
1986", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC0984.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document is a preliminary discussion of the design of a personal-computer-based distributed mail system.  Pcmail is a distributed mail system that provides mail service to an arbitrary number of users, each of which owns one or more personal computers (PCs).  The system is divided into two halves.  The first consists of a single entity called the repository.  The repository is a storage center for incoming mail.  Mail for a Pcmail user can arrive externally from the Internet or internally from other repository users.  The repository also maintains a stable copy of each user's mail state.  The repository is therefore typically a computer with a large amount of disk storage.  It is published for discussion and comment, and does not constitute a standard.  As the proposal may change, implementation of this document is not advised.  See RFC-993."];
