Hash and Stuffing: Overlooked Factors in
Network Device Benchmarking
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4814.html", target="_top", tooltip="Test engineers take pains to declare all factors that affect a given measurement, including intended load, packet length, test duration, and traffic orientation.  However, current benchmarking practice overlooks two factors that have a profound impact on test results.  First, existing methodologies do not require the reporting of addresses or other test traffic contents, even though these fields can affect test results.  Second, stuff bits and bytes inserted in test traffic by some link-layer technologies add significant and variable overhead, which in turn affects test results.  This document describes the effects of these factors; recommends guidelines for test traffic contents; and offers formulas for determining the probability of bit- and byte-stuffing in test traffic.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Benchmarking Virtual Switches in the
Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV)

This project has extended the current and completed work of the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group in the IETF and references existing literature.  The Benchmarking Methodology Working Group has traditionally conducted laboratory characterization of dedicated physical implementations of internetworking functions.  Therefore, this memo describes the additional considerations when virtual switches are implemented on general-purpose hardware.  The expanded tests and benchmarks are also influenced by the OPNFV mission to support virtualization of the telco infrastructure."];

Many of these terms and methods may be applicable to network equipment beyond the scope of this document as the technologies originally applied in the data center are deployed elsewhere."];
