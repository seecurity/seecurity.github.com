Message Submission BURL Extension

This specification extends the submission profile by adding a new BURL command that can be used to fetch submission data from an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) server.  This permits a mail client to inject content from an IMAP server into the SMTP infrastructure without downloading it to the client and uploading it back to the server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Internet Email to Support Diverse
Service Environments (Lemonade) Profile
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4550.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a profile (a set of required extensions, restrictions, and usage modes) of the IMAP and mail submission protocols. This profile allows clients (especially those that are constrained in memory, bandwidth, processing power, or other areas) to efficiently use IMAP and Submission to access and submit mail. This includes the ability to forward received mail without needing to download and upload the mail, to optimize submission, and to efficiently resynchronize in case of loss of connectivity with the server. The Internet Email to Support Diverse Service Environments (Lemonade) profile relies upon extensions to IMAP and Mail Submission protocols; specifically, the URLAUTH and CATENATE IMAP protocol (RFC 3501) extensions and the BURL extension to the SUBMIT protocol (RFC 4409).

Multicast Email (MULE) over Allied

This document defines MULE (Multicast Email), an application protocol for transferring Internet Mail messages (as described in RFC 5322) over P_MUL (as defined in ACP 142). MULE enables transfer between Message Transfer Agents (MTAs). It doesn't provide a service similar to SMTP Submission (as described in RFC 6409). This document explains how MULE can be used in conjunction with SMTP (RFC 5321), including some common SMTP extensions, to provide an alternate MTA-to-MTA transfer mechanism. This is not an IETF specification; it describes an existing implementation. It is provided in order to facilitate interoperable implementations and third-party diagnostics."];
