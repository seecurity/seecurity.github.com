Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.

IPv4 and IPv6 Infrastructure Addresses

2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6515.html", target="_top", tooltip="To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) service, Provider Edge routers originate BGP Update messages that carry Multicast-VPN (MCAST-VPN) BGP routes; they also originate unicast VPN routes that carry MVPN-specific attributes.  These routes encode addresses from the customer's address space, as well as addresses from the provider's address space.  These two address spaces are independent, and the address family (IPv4 or IPv6) of the two spaces may or may not be the same.  These routes always contain an address family field that specifies whether the customer addresses are IPv4 addresses or whether they are IPv6 addresses.  However, there is no field that explicitly specifies the address family of the provider addresses.  To ensure interoperability, this document specifies that provider IPv4 addresses are always encoded in these update messages as 4-octet addresses, and that the distinction between IPv4 and IPv6 is signaled solely by the length of the address field.
