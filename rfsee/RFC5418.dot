Control And Provisioning of Wireless
Access Points (CAPWAP) Threat Analysis
for IEEE 802.11 Deployments
2009", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Early Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) deployments feature a fat Access Point (AP), which serves as a \%stand-alone interface between the wired and wireless network segments.  However, this model raises scaling, mobility, and manageability issues, and the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol is meant to address these issues.  CAPWAP effectively splits the fat AP functionality into two network elements, and the communication channel between these components may traverse potentially hostile hops.  This document analyzes the security exposure resulting from the introduction of CAPWAP and summarizes the associated security considerations for IEEE 802.11-based CAPWAP implementations and deployments.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In

Authentication Protocol (EAP)
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3579.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) support for the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), an authentication framework which supports multiple authentication mechanisms.  In the proposed scheme, the Network Access Server (NAS) forwards EAP packets to and from the RADIUS server, encapsulated within EAP-Message attributes.  This has the advantage of allowing the NAS to support any EAP authentication method, without the need for method- specific code, which resides on the RADIUS server.  While EAP was originally developed for use with PPP, it is now also in use with IEEE 802.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
