A Model for IETF Process Experiments
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3933.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IETF has designed process changes over the last ten years in one of two ways: announcement by the IESG, sometimes based on informal agreements with limited community involvement and awareness, and formal use of the same mechanism used for protocol specification. The first mechanism has often proven to be too lightweight, the second too heavyweight. This document specifies a middle-ground approach to the system of making changes to IETF process, one that relies heavily on a propose and carry out an experiment, evaluate the experiment, and then establish permanent procedures based on operational experience model rather than those previously attempted. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
