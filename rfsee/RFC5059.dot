Bootstrap Router (BSR) Mechanism for
Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies the Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism for the class of multicast routing protocols in the PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) family that use the concept of a Rendezvous Point as a means for receivers to discover the sources that send to a particular multicast group.  BSR is one way that a multicast router can learn the set of group-to-RP mappings required in order to function.  The mechanism is dynamic, largely self-configuring, and robust to router failure.
