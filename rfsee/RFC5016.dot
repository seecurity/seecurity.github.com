The ultimate goal of this framework is to permit a signing domain to assert responsibility for a message, thus protecting message signer identity and the integrity of the messages they convey while retaining the functionality of Internet email as it is known today.  Protection of email identity may assist in the global control of spam and phishing. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
