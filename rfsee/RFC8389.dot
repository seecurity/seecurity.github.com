Management Framework

This Framework is derived from and builds upon both the original Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv1) and the second Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv2).  The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the Framework over time.  The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.  The document also recommends that RFCs 1157, 1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic status.  This document obsoletes RFC 2570.

This Transport Model is designed to meet the security and operational needs of network administrators. It supports the sending of SNMP messages over TLS/TCP and DTLS/UDP. The TLS mode can make use of TCP's improved support for larger packet sizes and the DTLS mode provides potentially superior operation in environments where a connectionless (e.g., UDP) transport is preferred. Both TLS and DTLS integrate well into existing public keying infrastructures. This document also defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols.
