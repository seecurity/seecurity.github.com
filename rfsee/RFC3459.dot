Critical Content Multi-purpose Internet
Mail Extensions (MIME) Parameter
2003", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the use of a mechanism for identifying body parts that a sender deems critical in a multi-part Internet mail message.  The mechanism described is a parameter to Content-Disposition, as described by RFC 3204.  By knowing what parts of a message the sender deems critical, a content gateway can intelligently handle multi-part messages when providing gateway services to systems of lesser capability.  Critical content can help a content gateway to decide what parts to forward.  It can indicate how hard a gateway should try to deliver a body part.  It can help the gateway to pick body parts that are safe to silently delete when a system of lesser capability receives a message.  In addition, critical content can help the gateway chose the notification strategy for the receiving system.  Likewise, if the sender expects the destination to do some processing on a body part, critical content allows the sender to mark body parts that the receiver must process.

Additional Data Related to an Emergency
Call

This document describes data structures and mechanisms to convey such data to the PSAP. The intent is that every emergency call carry as much of the information described here as possible using the mechanisms described here. The mechanisms permit the data to be conveyed by reference (as an external resource) or by value (within the body of a SIP message or a location object). This follows the tradition of prior emergency services standardization work where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling (i.e., in the body of the SIP message) or by reference."];
