Coupled SIP Conferencing

Separate documents will map the requirements to existing protocol primitives, define new protocol extensions, and introduce new protocols as needed.  Together, these documents will provide a guide for building interoperable SIP conferencing applications.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

A Framework for Centralized Conferencing

The framework allows participants using various call signaling protocols, such as SIP, H.323, Jabber, Q.931 or ISDN User Part (ISUP), to exchange media in a centralized unicast conference.  The Centralized Conferencing Framework defines logical entities and naming conventions.  The framework also outlines a set of conferencing protocols, which are complementary to the call signaling protocols, for building advanced conferencing applications.  The framework binds all the defined components together for the benefit of builders of conferencing systems. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
