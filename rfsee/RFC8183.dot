An Out-of-Band Setup Protocol for
Resource Public Key Infrastructure
(RPKI) Production Services
2017", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This note describes a simple out-of-band protocol to ease setup of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) provisioning and publication protocols between two parties. The protocol is encoded in a small number of XML messages, which can be passed back and forth by any mutually agreeable means which provides acceptable data integrity and authentication. This setup protocol is not part of the provisioning or publication protocol; rather, it is intended to simplify configuration of these protocols by setting up relationships and exchanging keying material used to authenticate those relationships.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

A Protocol for Provisioning Resource

The protocol supports the transmission of requests from the subject, and corresponding responses from the issuer encompassing the actions of certificate issuance, certificate revocation, and certificate status information reports.  This protocol is intended to be limited to the application of Internet Number Resource Certificate management and is not intended to be used as part of a more general certificate management framework.
