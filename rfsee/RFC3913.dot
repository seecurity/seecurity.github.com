Border Gateway Multicast Protocol
(BGMP): Protocol Specification
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the Border Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP), a protocol for inter-domain multicast routing.  BGMP builds shared trees for active multicast groups, and optionally allows receiver domains to build source-specific, inter-domain, distribution branches where needed.  BGMP natively supports source-specific multicast (SSM).  To also support any-source multicast (ASM), BGMP requires that each multicast group be associated with a single root (in BGMP it is referred to as the root domain).  It requires that different ranges of the multicast address space are associated (e.g., with Unicast-Prefix-Based Multicast addressing) with different domains.  Each of these domains then becomes the root of the shared domain-trees for all groups in its range.  Multicast participants will generally receive better multicast service if the session initiator's address allocator selects addresses from its own domain's part of the space, thereby causing the root domain to be local to at least one of the session participants.

Analysis of Inter-Domain Routing

The analysis is carried out with respect to RFC 1126 and other IDR requirements and design efforts looking at the routing system as it appeared to be in 2001 with editorial additions reflecting developments up to 2006.  It is the companion document to A Set of Possible Requirements for a Future Routing Architecture (RFC 5772), which is a discussion of requirements for the future routing architecture, addressing systems developments and future routing protocols.  This document summarizes discussions held several years ago by members of the IRTF Routing Research Group (IRTF RRG) and other interested parties.  The document is published with the support of the IRTF RRG as a record of the work completed at that time, but with the understanding that it does not necessarily represent either the latest technical understanding or the technical consensus of the research group at the date of publication.
