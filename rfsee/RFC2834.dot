ARP and IP Broadcast over HIPPI-800

This memo defines a HARP that will interoperate between HIPPI-800 and HIPPI-6400 (also known as Gigabyte System Network, GSN).

IP and ARP on HIPPI

Another X3T9.3 draft describes the operation of HIPPI physical switches.  X3T9.3 chose to leave HIPPI networking issues largely outside the scope of their standards; this document discusses methods of using of ANSI standard HIPPI hardware and protocols in the context of the Internet, including the use of HIPPI switches as LANs and interoperation with other networks.
