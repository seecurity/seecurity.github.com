On Packet Switches With Infinite Storage
1985", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular problem in the ARPA-Internet and possible methods of solution.  Most prior work on congestion in datagram systems focuses on buffer management.  In this memo the case of a packet switch with infinite storage is considered.  Such a packet switch can never run out of buffers.  It can, however, still become congested.  The meaning of congestion in an infinite-storage system is explored.  An unexpected result is found that shows a datagram network with infinite storage, first-in-first-out queuing, at least two packet switches, and a finite packet lifetime will, under overload, drop all packets.  By attacking the problem of congestion for the infinite-storage case, new solutions applicable to switches with finite storage may be found.  No proposed solutions this document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet at this time."];
