Support of Address Families in OSPFv3

OSPFv3 Link State Advertisement (LSA)
Extensibility
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8362.html", target="_top", tooltip="OSPFv3 requires functional extension beyond what can readily be done with the fixed-format Link State Advertisement (LSA) as described in RFC 5340. Without LSA extension, attributes associated with OSPFv3 links and advertised IPv6 prefixes must be advertised in separate LSAs and correlated to the fixed-format LSAs. This document extends the LSA format by encoding the existing OSPFv3 LSA information in Type-Length-Value (TLV) tuples and allowing advertisement of additional information with additional TLVs. Backward-compatibility mechanisms are also described. This document updates RFC 5340, OSPF for IPv6, and RFC 5838, Support of Address Families in OSPFv3, by providing TLV-based encodings for the base OSPFv3 unicast support and OSPFv3 address family support."];

OSPFv3 as a Provider Edge to Customer
Edge (PE-CE) Routing Protocol
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6565.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many Service Providers (SPs) offer Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to their customers using a technique in which Customer Edge (CE) routers are routing peers of Provider Edge (PE) routers.  The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to distribute the customer's routes across the provider's IP backbone network, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer packets across the provider's backbone.  Support currently exists for both IPv4 and IPv6 VPNs; however, only Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2) as PE-CE protocol is specified.  This document extends those specifications to support OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) as a PE-CE routing protocol.
