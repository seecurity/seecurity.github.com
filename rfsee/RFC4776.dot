There are, however, circumstances that arise when information needs to be constrained in how it is represented.  In these circumstances, the range of options that need to be implemented are reduced.  There is growing interest in being able to use location information contained in a PIDF-LO for routing applications.  To allow successful interoperability between applications, location information needs to be normative and more tightly constrained than is currently specified in RFC 4119 (PIDF-LO).  This document makes recommendations on how to constrain, represent, and interpret locations in a PIDF-LO.  It further recommends a subset of Geography Markup Language (GML) 3.1.1 that is mandatory to implement by applications involved in location-based routing. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Use of Device Identity in HTTP-Enabled

This is sufficient in environments where the location of a Device can be determined based on its IP address. Two additional use cases are addressed by this document. In the first, location configuration requires additional or alternative identifiers from the source IP address provided in the request. In the second, an entity other than the Device requests the location of the Device. This document extends the HELD protocol to allow the location request message to carry Device identifiers. Privacy and security considerations describe the conditions where requests containing identifiers are permitted. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
