RMD-QOSM: The NSIS Quality-of-Service
Model for Resource Management in
Diffserv
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5977.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) Quality-of-Service (QoS) Model for networks that use the Resource Management in Diffserv (RMD) concept.  RMD is a technique for adding admission control and preemption function to Differentiated Services (Diffserv) networks.  The RMD QoS Model allows devices external to the RMD network to signal reservation requests to Edge nodes in the RMD network.  The RMD Ingress Edge nodes classify the incoming flows into traffic classes and signals resource requests for the corresponding traffic class along the data path to the Egress Edge nodes for each flow.  Egress nodes reconstitute the original requests and continue forwarding them along the data path towards the final destination.  In addition, RMD defines notification functions to indicate overload situations within the domain to the Edge nodes.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

RSVP Extensions for Admission Priority
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6401.html", target="_top", tooltip="Some applications require the ability to provide an elevated probability of session establishment to specific sessions in times of network congestion. When supported over the Internet Protocol suite, this may be facilitated through a network-layer admission control solution that supports prioritized access to resources (e.g., bandwidth). These resources may be explicitly set aside for prioritized sessions, or may be shared with other sessions. This document specifies extensions to the Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) that can be used to support such an admission priority capability at the network layer. Based on current security concerns, these extensions are intended for use in a single administrative domain. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Generic Connection Admission Control
(GCAC) Algorithm Specification for
IP/MPLS Networks
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6601.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents a generic connection admission control (GCAC) reference model and algorithm for IP-/MPLS-based networks.  Service provider (SP) IP/MPLS networks need an MPLS GCAC mechanism, as one motivational example, to reject Voice over IP (VoIP) calls when additional calls would adversely affect calls already in progress.  Without MPLS GCAC, connections on congested links will suffer degraded quality.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm can be optionally implemented in vendor equipment and deployed by service providers.  MPLS GCAC interoperates between vendor equipment and across multiple service provider domains.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm uses available standard mechanisms for MPLS-based networks, such as RSVP, Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE), Path Computation Element (PCE), Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS), Diffserv, and OSPF.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm does not include aspects of CAC that might be considered vendor proprietary implementations, such as detailed path selection mechanisms.  MPLS GCAC functions are implemented in a distributed manner to deliver the objective Quality of Service (QoS) for specified QoS constraints.  The objective is that the source is able to compute a source route with high likelihood that via-elements along the selected path will in fact admit the request.  In some cases (e.g., multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes)), this objective cannot always be met, but this document summarizes methods that partially meet this objective.  MPLS GCAC is applicable to any service or flow that must meet an objective QoS (delay, jitter, packet loss rate) for a specified quantity of traffic.

In some instances, operators are also migrating existing services from RSVP-TE to SR LSPs.  For example, there might be certain services that are well suited for SR and need to coexist with RSVP-TE in the same network.  Such introduction or migration of traffic to SR might require coexistence with RSVP-TE in the same network for an extended period of time, depending on the operator's intent.  The following document provides solution options for keeping the traffic engineering database consistent across the network, accounting for the different bandwidth utilization between SR and RSVP-TE."];
