Use of BGP Large Communities

BGP Wedgies

In this memo we will describe a class of BGP configurations for which there is more than one potential outcome, and where forwarding states other than the intended state are equally stable.  Also, the stable state where BGP converges may be selected by BGP in a non-deterministic manner.  These stable, but unintended, BGP states are termed here BGP Wedgies.

Internet Exchange BGP Route Server

Multilateral interconnection is a method of exchanging routing information among three or more External BGP (EBGP) speakers using a single intermediate broker system, referred to as a route server.  Route servers are typically used on shared access media networks, such as IXPs, to facilitate simplified interconnection among multiple Internet routers."];

Internet Exchange BGP Route Server
Operations

While bilateral External BGP (EBGP) sessions between exchange participants were historically the most common means of exchanging reachability information over an IXP, the overhead associated with this interconnection method causes serious operational and administrative scaling problems for IXP participants. Multilateral interconnection using Internet route servers can dramatically reduce the administrative and operational overhead associated with connecting to IXPs; in some cases, route servers are used by IXP participants as their preferred means of exchanging routing information. This document describes operational considerations for multilateral interconnections at IXPs."];

Export of BGP Community Information in

According to the network operator's BGP community planning, network traffic information can then be accumulated and analyzed at the BGP community granularity, which represents the traffic of different kinds of customers, services, or geographical regions.  Network traffic information at the BGP community granularity is useful for network traffic analysis and engineering."];
