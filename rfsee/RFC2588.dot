IP Multicast and Firewalls

We also explain why some firewall mechanisms - such as SOCKS - that were designed specifically for unicast traffic, are less appropriate for multicast.

The target audience is those people seeking guidance on how to construct an appropriate Internet Protocol Suite profile for the Smart Grid.  In practice, such a profile would consist of selecting what is needed for Smart Grid deployment from the picture presented here.

Comparison of Different NAT Traversal
Techniques for Media Controlled by the
Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7604.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes several Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal techniques that were considered to be used for establishing the RTP media flows controlled by the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP).  Each technique includes a description of how it would be used, the security implications of using it, and any other deployment considerations it has.  There are also discussions on how NAT traversal techniques relate to firewalls and how each technique can be applied in different use cases.  These findings were used when selecting the NAT traversal for RTSP 2.0, which is specified in a separate document."];
