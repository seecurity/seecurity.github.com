Use of VLANs for IPv4-IPv6 Coexistence
in Enterprise Networks
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Ethernet VLANs are quite commonly used in enterprise networks for the purposes of traffic segregation.  This document describes how such VLANs can be readily used to deploy IPv6 networking in an enterprise, which focuses on the scenario of early deployment prior to availability of IPv6-capable switch-router equipment.  In this method, IPv6 may be routed in parallel with the existing IPv4 in the enterprise and delivered at Layer 2 via VLAN technology.  The IPv6 connectivity to the enterprise may or may not enter the site via the same physical link.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Operational Guidance for IPv6 Deployment
in IPv4 Sites Using the Intra-Site
Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol
(ISATAP)
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6964.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many end-user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly IPv4 internal infrastructures.  These sites range in size from small home/office networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that IPv4 provides satisfactory internal routing and addressing services for most applications.  As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed, however, end-user devices within such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6 functionality.  This document therefore provides operational guidance for deployment of IPv6 within predominantly IPv4 sites using the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)."];
