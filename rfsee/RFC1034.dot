In the interim period before the DNS protocol can be secured more fully, measures can already be taken to harden the DNS to make 'spoofing' a recursing nameserver many orders of magnitude harder. Even a cryptographically secured DNS benefits from having the ability to discard bogus responses quickly, as this potentially saves large amounts of computation. By describing certain behavior that has previously not been standardized, this document sets out how to make the DNS more resilient against accepting incorrect responses.

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
Service Overview

It also describes how DKIM relates to other IETF message signature technologies.  It is intended for those who are adopting, developing, or deploying DKIM.  DKIM allows an organization to take responsibility for transmitting a message, in a way that can be verified by a recipient.  The organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents.  A message can contain multiple signatures from the same or different organizations involved with the message.  DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for email, using public-key cryptography, with the domain name service as its key server technology (RFC 4871).  This permits verification of a responsible organization, as well as the integrity of the message contents.  DKIM also enables a mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish information about their email signing practices; this will permit email receivers to make additional assessments about messages.  DKIM's authentication of email identity can assist in the global control of spam and phishing.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Connection latching can be used to protect applications against accidentally exposing live packet flows to unintended peers, whether as the result of a reconfiguration of IPsec or as the result of using weak peer identity to peer address associations. Weak association of peer ID and peer addresses is at the core of Better Than Nothing Security (BTNS); thus, connection latching can add a significant measure of protection to BTNS IPsec nodes. Finally, the availability of IPsec channels will make it possible to use channel binding to IPsec channels. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Devices in such environments may occasionally originate Domain Name System (DNS) queries (so-called reverse lookups) corresponding to those private-use addresses. Since the addresses concerned have only local significance, it is good practice for site administrators to ensure that such queries are answered locally. However, it is not uncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation path in the public DNS instead of being answered within the site. It is not possible for public DNS servers to give useful answers to such queries.

Changes in core network functions impacting reachability cannot be automated because of ongoing connectivity requirements for the OAM equipment itself, and widely used OAM protocols are not secure enough to be carried across the network without security concerns.

Negative Caching of DNS Resolution
Failures
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9520.html", target="_top", tooltip="In the DNS, resolvers employ caching to reduce both latency for end users and load on authoritative name servers. The process of resolution may result in one of three types of responses: (1) a response containing the requested data, (2) a response indicating the requested data does not exist, or (3) a non-response due to a resolution failure in which the resolver does not receive any useful information regarding the data's existence. This document concerns itself only with the third type. RFC 2308 specifies requirements for DNS negative caching. There, caching of TYPE 2 responses is mandatory and caching of TYPE 3 responses is optional. This document updates RFC 2308 to require negative caching for DNS resolution failures. RFC 4035 allows DNSSEC validation failure caching. This document updates RFC 4035 to require caching for DNSSEC validation failures. RFC 4697 prohibits aggressive requerying for NS records at a failed zone's parent zone. This document updates RFC 4697 to expand this requirement to all query types and to all ancestor zones."];

Simple Provisioning of Public Names for
Residential Networks
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9526.html", target="_top", tooltip="Home network owners may have devices or services hosted on their home network that they wish to access from the Internet (i.e., from a network outside of the home network). Home networks are increasingly numbered using IPv6 addresses, which in principle makes this access simpler, but accessing home networks from the Internet requires the names and IP addresses of these devices and services to be made available in the public DNS. This document describes how a Home Naming Authority (NHA) instructs the outsourced infrastructure to publish these pieces of information in the public DNS. The names and IP addresses of the home network are set in the Public Homenet Zone by the Homenet Naming Authority (HNA), which in turn instructs an outsourced infrastructure to publish the zone on behalf of the home network owner."];

JSContact: A JSON Representation of

It aims to be an alternative to the vCard data format and to be unambiguous, extendable, and simple to process.  In contrast to the JSON-based jCard format, it is not a direct mapping from the vCard data model and expands semantics where appropriate.  Two additional specifications define new vCard elements and how to convert between JSContact and vCard."];

The DNS Zone Version (ZONEVERSION)
Option
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9660.html", target="_top", tooltip="The DNS ZONEVERSION option is a way for DNS clients to request, and for authoritative DNS servers to provide, information regarding the version of the zone from which a response is generated. The SERIAL field from the Start of Authority (SOA) resource record (RR) is a good example of a zone's version, and it is the only one defined by this specification. Additional version types may be defined by future specifications. Including zone version data in a response simplifies and improves the quality of debugging and diagnostics since the version and the DNS answer are provided atomically. This can be especially useful for zones and DNS providers that leverage IP anycast or multiple backend systems. It functions similarly to the DNS Name Server Identifier (NSID) option described in RFC 5001."];
