Extensible Markup Language (XML) Formats
for Representing Resource Lists
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4826.html", target="_top", tooltip="In multimedia communications, presence, and instant messaging systems, there is a need to define Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) that represent services that are associated with a group of users.  One example is a resource list service.  If a user sends a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) SUBSCRIBE message to the URI representing the resource list service, the server will obtain the state of the users in the associated group, and provide it to the sender.  To facilitate definition of these services, this specification defines two Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents.  One document contains service URIs, along with their service definition and a reference to the associated group of users.  The second document contains the user lists that are referenced from the first.  This list of users can be utilized by other applications and services.  Both documents can be created and managed with the XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Completion of Calls for the Session

For the realization of a more comprehensive solution with queuing, this document introduces an architecture for implementing these features in the Session Initiation Protocol where completion of calls implementations associated with the caller's and callee's endpoints cooperate to place the caller's request for completion of calls into a queue at the callee's endpoint; when a caller's request is ready to be serviced, re-attempt of the original, failed call is then made. The architecture is designed to interoperate well with existing completion of calls solutions in other networks."];

However, it does not define a way for a client involved in a conference to determine if the conference focus supports CCMP. This information would allow a CCMP-enabled client that joins a conference using SIP to also register for the Centralized Conferencing (XCON) conference event package and take advantage of CCMP operations on the conference. This document describes two mechanisms, depending upon the need of the User Agent (UA), to address the above limitation. The first mechanism uses the Call-Info header field, and the second mechanism defines a new value for the purpose header field parameter in the <service-uris> element in the SIP conferencing event package."];
