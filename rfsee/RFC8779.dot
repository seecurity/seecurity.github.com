In the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture, a Path Computation Client (PCC) may want a path to be computed for one or more TE LSPs according to a specific objective function. Thus, the PCC needs to instruct the PCE to use the correct objective function. Furthermore, it is possible that not all PCEs support the same set of objective functions; therefore, it is useful for the PCC to be able to automatically discover the set of objective functions supported by each PCE. This document defines extensions to the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) to allow a PCE to indicate the set of objective functions it supports. Extensions are also defined so that a PCC can indicate in a path computation request the required objective function, and a PCE can report in a path computation reply the objective function that was used for path computation.

Where the TE LSP crosses multiple domains, such as Autonomous Systems (ASes), the path may be computed by multiple PCEs that cooperate, with each responsible for computing a segment of the path. However, in some cases (e.g., when ASes are administered by separate Service Providers), it would break confidentiality rules for a PCE to supply a path segment to a PCE in another domain, thus disclosing AS-internal topology information. This issue may be circumvented by returning a loose hop and by invoking a new path computation from the domain boundary Label Switching Router (LSR) during TE LSP setup as the signaling message enters the second domain, but this technique has several issues including the problem of maintaining path diversity. This document defines a mechanism to hide the contents of a segment of a path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS).

The Path Computation Element

Path provisioning in WSONs requires an RWA process.  From a path computation perspective, wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing constraint to optical path computation."];

Path Computation Element Communication
Protocol (PCEP) Procedures and
Extensions for Using the PCE as a
Central Controller (PCECC) of LSPs
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9050.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) systems. A PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it. Thus, the Label Switched Path (LSP) can be calculated/set up/initiated and the label-forwarding entries can also be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network device along the path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible. This document specifies the procedures and Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions for using the PCE as the central controller for provisioning labels along the path of the static LSP."];

Update to the IANA Path Communication
Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers
Registration Procedures and the
Allowance of Experimental Error Codes
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9756.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document updates the registration procedure within the IANA Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers registry group. This specification changes some of the registries with Standards Action to IETF Review as defined in RFC 8126 and thus updates RFCs 8231, 8233, 8281, 8623, 8664, 8685, 8697, 8733, 8745, 8779, 8780, 8800, 8934, 9050, 9059, 9168, 9357, 9504, 9603, and 9604. Designating experimental use sub-ranges within codepoint registries is often beneficial for protocol experimentation in controlled environments. Although the registries for PCEP messages, objects, and TLV types have sub-ranges assigned for Experimental Use, the registry for PCEP Error-Types and Error-values currently does not. This document updates RFC 5440 by designating a specific range of PCEP Error-Types for Experimental Use."];
