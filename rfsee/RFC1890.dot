RTP Profile for Audio and Video
Conferences with Minimal Control
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3551.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a profile called RTP/AVP for the use of the real-time transport protocol (RTP), version 2, and the associated control protocol, RTCP, within audio and video multiparticipant conferences with minimal control.  It provides interpretations of generic fields within the RTP specification suitable for audio and video conferences.  In particular, this document defines a set of default mappings from payload type numbers to encodings.  This document also describes how audio and video data may be carried within RTP.  It defines a set of standard encodings and their names when used within RTP.  The descriptions provide pointers to reference implementations and the detailed standards.  This document is meant as an aid for implementors of audio, video and other real-time multimedia applications.  This memorandum obsoletes RFC 1890.  It is mostly backwards-compatible except for functions removed because two interoperable implementations were not found.  The additions to RFC 1890 codify existing practice in the use of payload formats under this profile and include new payload formats defined since RFC 1890 was published. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Gateway Control Protocol Version 1

The protocol presented in this document meets the requirements for a media gateway control protocol as presented in RFC 2805.  This document replaces RFC 3015.  It is the result of continued cooperation between the IETF Megaco Working Group and ITU-T Study Group 16.  It incorporates the original text of RFC 3015, modified by corrections and clarifications discussed on the Megaco E-mail list and incorporated into the Study Group 16 Implementor's Guide for Recommendation H.248.  The present version of this document underwent ITU-T Last Call as Recommendation H.248 Amendment 1.  Because of ITU-T renumbering, it was published by the ITU-T as Recommendation H.248.1 (03/2002), Gateway Control Protocol Version 1.  Users of this specification are advised to consult the H.248 Sub-series Implementors' Guide at http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/com16/implgd for additional corrections and clarifications.

IAB Concerns Regarding Congestion
Control for Voice Traffic in the
Internet
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3714.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses IAB concerns about effective end-to-end congestion control for best-effort voice traffic in the Internet.  These concerns have to do with fairness, user quality, and with the dangers of congestion collapse.  The concerns are particularly relevant in light of the absence of a widespread Quality of Service (QoS) deployment in the Internet, and the likelihood that this situation will not change much in the near term.  This document is not making any recommendations about deployment paths for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in terms of QoS support, and is not claiming that best-effort service can be relied upon to give acceptable performance for VoIP.  We are merely observing that voice traffic is occasionally deployed as best-effort traffic over some links in the Internet, that we expect this occasional deployment to continue, and that we have concerns about the lack of effective end-to-end congestion control for this best-effort voice traffic.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
