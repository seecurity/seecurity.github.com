PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
Specification Version 1.0
1997", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes PNG (Portable Network Graphics), an extensible file format for the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images. PNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many common uses of TIFF. Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor images are supported, plus an optional alpha channel. Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits. PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such as the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive display option. PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity checking and simple detection of common transmission errors. Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color matching on heterogeneous platforms. This specification defines the Internet Media Type image/png.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9639.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) format and its streamable subset.  FLAC is designed to reduce the amount of computer storage space needed to store digital audio signals.  It does this losslessly, i.e., it does so without losing information.  FLAC is free in the sense that its specification is open and its reference implementation is open source.  Compared to other lossless audio coding formats, FLAC is a format with low complexity and can be encoded and decoded with little computing resources.  Decoding of FLAC has been implemented independently for many different platforms, and both encoding and decoding can be implemented without needing floating-point arithmetic."];
