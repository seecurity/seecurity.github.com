It defines recommendations and requirements for the use of IPv6 UDP datagrams with a zero UDP checksum.  It describes the issues and design principles that need to be considered when UDP is used with IPv6 to support tunnel encapsulations, and it examines the role of the IPv6 UDP transport checksum.  The document also identifies issues and constraints for deployment on network paths that include middleboxes.  An appendix presents a summary of the trade-offs that were considered in evaluating the safety of the update to RFC 2460 that changes the use of the UDP checksum with IPv6."];
