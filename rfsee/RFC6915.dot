Flow Identity Extension for HTTP-Enabled
Location Delivery (HELD)
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="RFC 6155 specifies an extension for the HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol, allowing the use of an IP address and port number to request a Device location based on an individual packet flow. However, certain kinds of NAT require that identifiers for both ends of the packet flow must be specified in order to unambiguously satisfy the location request. This document specifies an XML Schema and a URN Sub-Namespace for a Flow Identity Extension for HELD to support this requirement. This document updates RFC 6155 by deprecating the port number elements specified therein."];

In the first, location configuration requires additional or alternative identifiers from the source IP address provided in the request. In the second, an entity other than the Device requests the location of the Device. This document extends the HELD protocol to allow the location request message to carry Device identifiers.

SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet network such as IP. It offers the following services to its users: -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data, -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size, -- sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages, -- optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association. The design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
