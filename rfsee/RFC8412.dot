NEA provides owners of networks (e.g., an enterprise offering remote access) a mechanism to evaluate the posture of a system.  This may take place during the request for network access and/or subsequently at any time while connected to the network.  The learned posture information can then be applied to a variety of compliance-oriented decisions.  The posture information is frequently useful for detecting systems that are lacking or have out-of-date security protection mechanisms such as: anti-virus and host-based firewall software.  In order to provide context for the requirements, a reference model and terminology are introduced.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
