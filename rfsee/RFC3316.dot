DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in Long-Term
Evolution (LTE) Networks
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6653.html", target="_top", tooltip="As interest in IPv6 deployment in cellular networks increases, several migration issues have been being raised; IPv6 prefix management is the issue addressed in this document.  Based on the idea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes, we use DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation to address such prefix management issues as an access router offloading delegation of prefixes and release tasks to a DHCPv6 server.  The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node from the DHCPv6 server.  The access router may next do stateless or stateful address allocation to the mobile node, e.g., with a Router Advertisement or using DHCP.  We also describe prefix management using Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers.

Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8996.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document formally deprecates Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346). Accordingly, those documents have been moved to Historic status. These versions lack support for current and recommended cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms, and various government and industry profiles of applications using TLS now mandate avoiding these old TLS versions. TLS version 1.2 became the recommended version for IETF protocols in 2008 (subsequently being obsoleted by TLS version 1.3 in 2018), providing sufficient time to transition away from older versions. Removing support for older versions from implementations reduces the attack surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines library and product maintenance. This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC 4347) but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1. This document updates many RFCs that normatively refer to TLS version 1.0 or TLS version 1.1, as described herein. This document also updates the best practices for TLS usage in RFC 7525; hence, it is part of BCP 195."];
