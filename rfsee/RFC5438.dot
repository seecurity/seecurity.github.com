Message Disposition Notification
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3798.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo defines a MIME content-type that may be used by a mail user agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a message after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient.  This content-type is intended to be machine-processable.  Additional message headers are also defined to permit Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender of a message.  The purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary LAN-based systems, and often referred to as read receipts, acknowledgements, or receipt notifications. The intention is to do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past.  Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary LAN-based systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of foreign addresses, in addition to those normally used in Internet Mail.  Additional attributes may also be defined to support tunneling of foreign notifications through Internet Mail. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Extension for Instant Messaging
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3428.html", target="_top", tooltip="Instant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer of messages between users in near real-time.  These messages are usually, but not required to be, short.  IMs are often used in a conversational mode, that is, the transfer of messages back and forth is fast enough for participants to maintain an interactive conversation.  This document proposes the MESSAGE method, an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that allows the transfer of Instant Messages.  Since the MESSAGE request is an extension to SIP, it inherits all the request routing and security features of that protocol.  MESSAGE requests carry the content in the form of MIME body parts.  MESSAGE requests do not themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal usage each Instant Message stands alone, much like pager messages.  MESSAGE requests may be sent in the context of a dialog initiated by some other SIP request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.
