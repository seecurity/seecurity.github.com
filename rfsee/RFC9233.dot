Internationalized Domain Names for

That requirement, and its relationship to tables maintained by IANA, has caused significant confusion in the past.  This document makes adjustments to the review procedure based on experience and updates IDNA, specifically RFC 5892, to reflect those changes and to clarify the various relationships involved.

Inclusion in Labels in the DNS

It is unfortunately not possible to generate algorithms to determine whether permitting a code point presents a low risk.
