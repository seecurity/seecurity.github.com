Multiple Interfaces and Provisioning
Domains Problem Statement
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6418.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes issues encountered by a node attached to multiple provisioning domains.  This node receives configuration information from each of its provisioning domains, where some configuration objects are global to the node and others are local to the interface.  Issues such as selecting the wrong interface to send traffic happen when conflicting node-scoped configuration objects are received and inappropriately used.  Moreover, other issues are the result of simultaneous attachment to multiple networks, such as domain selection or addressing and naming space overlaps, regardless of the provisioning mechanism.  While multiple provisioning domains are typically seen on nodes with multiple interfaces, this document also discusses situations involving single-interface nodes.

Default Address Selection for Internet
Protocol version 6 (IPv6)
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3484.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes two algorithms, for source address selection and for destination address selection.  The algorithms specify default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations.  They do not override choices made by applications or upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the development of more advanced mechanisms for address selection.  The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior.  In dual stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses - depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice-versa.  All IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers, must implement default address selection as defined in this specification. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues experienced by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks simultaneously.

PvD-aware nodes learn PvD-specific information from the networks they are attached to and/or other sources.  PvDs are used to enable separation and configuration consistency in the presence of multiple concurrent connections."];
