IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
Information Elements for Logging NAT
Events
2017", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Network operators require NAT devices to log events like creation and deletion of translations and information about the resources that the NAT device is managing.  In many cases, the logs are essential to identify an attacker or a host that was used to launch malicious attacks and for various other purposes of accounting.  Since there is no standard way of logging this information, different NAT devices use proprietary formats; hence, it is difficult to expect consistent behavior.  This lack of standardization makes it difficult to write the Collector applications that would receive this data and process it to present useful information.  This document describes the formats for logging NAT events."];

The Syslog Protocol
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5424.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the syslog protocol, which is used to convey event notification messages. This protocol utilizes a layered architecture, which allows the use of any number of transport protocols for transmission of syslog messages. It also provides a message format that allows vendor-specific extensions to be provided in a structured way. This document has been written with the original design goals for traditional syslog in mind. The need for a new layered specification has arisen because standardization efforts for reliable and secure syslog extensions suffer from the lack of a Standards-Track and transport-independent RFC. Without this document, each other standard needs to define its own syslog packet format and transport mechanism, which over time will introduce subtle compatibility issues. This document tries to provide a foundation that syslog extensions can build on. This layered architecture approach also provides a solid basis that allows code to be written once for each syslog feature rather than once for each transport. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
