A Session Description Protocol (SDP)
Offer/Answer Mechanism to Enable File

SDP is extended to describe the attributes of the files to be transferred.  The offerer can describe either the files it wants to send or the files it would like to receive.  The answerer can either accept or reject the offer separately for each individual file.  The transfer of one or more files is initiated after a successful negotiation.  The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is defined as the default mechanism to actually carry the files between the endpoints.  The conventions on how to use MSRP for file transfer are also provided in this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Multiple Attachments for Electronic Data
Interchange - Internet Integration
(EDIINT)
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6362.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Electronic Data Interchange - Internet Integration (EDIINT) AS1, AS2, and AS3 messages were designed specifically for the transport of EDI documents.  Since multiple interchanges could be placed within a single EDI document, there was not a need for sending multiple EDI documents in a single message.  As adoption of EDIINT grew, other uses developed aside from single EDI document transport.  Some transactions required multiple attachments to be interpreted together and stored in a single message.  This Informational RFC describes how multiple documents, including non-EDI payloads, can be attached and transmitted in a single EDIINT transport message.  The attachments are stored within the MIME multipart/related structure.  A minimal list of content-types to be supported as attachments is provided.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

An Extension for Application-Layer
Traffic Optimization (ALTO): Path Vector
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9275.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol.  It extends the ALTO cost map and ALTO property map services so that an application can decide to which endpoint(s) to connect based not only on numerical/ordinal cost values but also on fine-grained abstract information regarding the paths.  This is useful for applications whose performance is impacted by specific components of a network on the end-to-end paths, e.g., they may infer that several paths share common links and prevent traffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths.  This extension introduces a new abstraction called the Abstract Network Element (ANE) to represent these components and encodes a network path as a vector of ANEs.  Thus, it provides a more complete but still abstract graph representation of the underlying network(s) for informed traffic optimization among endpoints."];
