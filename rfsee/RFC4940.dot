Assigning Experimental and Testing
Numbers Considered Useful
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3692.html", target="_top", tooltip="When experimenting with or extending protocols, it is often necessary to use some sort of protocol number or constant in order to actually test or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a closed environment.  For example, to test a new DHCP option, one needs an option number to identify the new function.  This document recommends that when writing IANA Considerations sections, authors should consider assigning a small range of numbers for experimentation purposes that implementers can use when testing protocol extensions or other new features.  This document reserves some ranges of numbers for experimentation purposes in specific protocols where the need to support experimentation has been identified."];

Graceful OSPF Restart

This is called graceful restart or non-stop forwarding.  A restarting router may not be capable of adjusting its forwarding in a timely manner when the network topology changes.  In order to avoid the possible resulting routing loops, the procedure in this memo automatically reverts to a normal OSPF restart when such a topology change is detected, or when one or more of the restarting router's neighbors do not support the enhancements in this memo.  Proper network operation during a graceful restart makes assumptions upon the operating environment of the restarting router; these assumptions are also documented."];
