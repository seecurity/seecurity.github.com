Although workshop participants and the community as a whole are still far from understanding how best to systematically address privacy within Internet standards development, workshop participants identified a number of potential next steps. For the IETF, these included the creation of a privacy directorate to review Internet-Drafts, further work on documenting privacy considerations for protocol developers, and a number of exploratory efforts concerning fingerprinting and anonymized routing. Potential action items for the W3C included investigating the formation of a privacy interest group and formulating guidance about fingerprinting, referrer headers, data minimization in APIs, usability, and general considerations for non-browser-based protocols.

Recommendations for DNS Privacy Service
Operators

With these recommendations, the operator can make deliberate decisions regarding which services to provide, as well as understanding how those decisions and the alternatives impact the privacy of users. This document also presents a non-normative framework to assist writers of a Recursive operator Privacy Statement, analogous to DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) Policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements described in RFC 6841."];

HTTP Client Hints
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8942.html", target="_top", tooltip="HTTP defines proactive content negotiation to allow servers to select the appropriate response for a given request, based upon the user agent's characteristics, as expressed in request headers. In practice, user agents are often unwilling to send those request headers, because it is not clear whether they will be used, and sending them impacts both performance and privacy. This document defines an Accept-CH response header that servers can use to advertise their use of request headers for proactive content negotiation, along with a set of guidelines for the creation of such headers, colloquially known as Client Hints."];

Temporary Address Extensions for

IPv6
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8981.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes an extension to IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration that causes hosts to generate temporary addresses with randomized interface identifiers for each prefix advertised with autoconfiguration enabled.  Changing addresses over time limits the window of time during which eavesdroppers and other information collectors may trivially perform address-based network-activity correlation when the same address is employed for multiple transactions by the same host.  Additionally, it reduces the window of exposure of a host as being accessible via an address that becomes revealed as a result of active communication.  This document obsoletes RFC 4941."];

DNS Terminology

Federated Authentication for the
Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)
Using OpenID Connect
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9560.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) provides Representational State Transfer (RESTful) web services to retrieve registration metadata from domain name and regional internet registries.  RDAP allows a server to make access control decisions based on client identity, and as such, it includes support for client identification features provided by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  Identification methods that require clients to obtain and manage credentials from every RDAP server operator present management challenges for both clients and servers, whereas a federated authentication system would make it easier to operate and use RDAP without the need to maintain server-specific client credentials.  This document describes a federated authentication system for RDAP based on OpenID Connect."];
