These include support for requesting TDM connections based on Synchronous Optical NETwork/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) as well as Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).  This document concentrates on the signaling aspects of the GMPLS suite of protocols, specifically GMPLS signaling using Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE).  It proposes additional extensions to these signaling protocols to support the capabilities of an ASON network.
