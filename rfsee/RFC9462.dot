Discovery of Designated Resolvers
2023", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR), a set of mechanisms for DNS clients to use DNS records to discover a resolver's encrypted DNS configuration.  An Encrypted DNS Resolver discovered in this manner is referred to as a Designated Resolver.  These mechanisms can be used to move from unencrypted DNS to encrypted DNS when only the IP address of a resolver is known.  These mechanisms are designed to be limited to cases where Unencrypted DNS Resolvers and their Designated Resolvers are operated by the same entity or cooperating entities.  It can also be used to discover support for encrypted DNS protocols when the name of an Encrypted DNS Resolver is known.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to those provided by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-line blocking issues inherent with TCP and provides more efficient packet-loss recovery than UDP.  DNS over QUIC (DoQ) has privacy properties similar to DNS over TLS (DoT) specified in RFC 7858, and latency characteristics similar to classic DNS over UDP.

SVCB records allow a service to be provided from multiple alternative endpoints, each with associated parameters (such as transport protocol configuration), and are extensible to support future uses (such as keys for encrypting the TLS ClientHello).  They also enable aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible with CNAME.  The HTTPS RR is a variation of SVCB for use with HTTP (see RFC 9110, HTTP Semantics).

This document describes how a host may automatically configure an interface with an IPv4 address within the 169.254/16 prefix that is valid for communication with other devices connected to the same physical (or logical) link. IPv4 Link-Local addresses are not suitable for communication with devices not directly connected to the same physical (or logical) link, and are only used where stable, routable addresses are not available (such as on ad hoc or isolated networks).

However, in its Domain Name Reservation Considerations section (Section 8.1), that specification (RFC 7050) indicates that the name actually has no particularly special properties that would require special handling. Consequently, despite the well-articulated special purpose of the name, 'ipv4only.arpa' was not recorded in the Special-Use Domain Names registry as a name with special properties. This document updates RFC 7050. It describes the special treatment required and formally declares the special properties of the name.
