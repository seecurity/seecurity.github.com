Processing of IPv6 Atomic Fragments
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6946.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IPv6 specification allows packets to contain a Fragment Header without the packet being actually fragmented into multiple pieces (we refer to these packets as atomic fragments).  Such packets are typically sent by hosts that have received an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big error message that advertises a Next-Hop MTU smaller than 1280 bytes, and are currently processed by some implementations as normal fragmented traffic (i.e., they are reassembled with any other queued fragments that supposedly correspond to the same original packet).  Thus, an attacker can cause hosts to employ atomic fragments by forging ICMPv6 Packet Too Big error messages, and then launch any fragmentation-based attacks against such traffic.  This document discusses the generation of the aforementioned atomic fragments and the corresponding security implications.  Additionally, this document formally updates RFC 2460 and RFC 5722, such that IPv6 atomic fragments are processed independently of any other fragments, thus completely eliminating the aforementioned attack vector."];

Security Implications of Predictable
Fragment Identification Values
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7739.html", target="_top", tooltip="IPv6 specifies the Fragment Header, which is employed for the fragmentation and reassembly mechanisms.  The Fragment Header contains an Identification field that, together with the IPv6 Source Address and the IPv6 Destination Address of a packet, identifies fragments that correspond to the same original datagram, such that they can be reassembled together by the receiving host.  The only requirement for setting the Identification field is that the corresponding value must be different than that employed for any other fragmented datagram sent recently with the same Source Address and Destination Address.  Some implementations use a simple global counter for setting the Identification field, thus leading to predictable Identification values.  This document analyzes the security implications of predictable Identification values, and provides implementation guidance for setting the Identification field of the Fragment Header, such that the aforementioned security implications are mitigated."];

Updated Specification of the IPv4 ID
Field

Because individual connections commonly exceed this speed, it is clear that existing systems violate the current specification.  This document updates the specification of the IPv4 ID field in RFCs 791, 1122, and 2003 to more closely reflect current practice and to more closely match IPv6 so that the field's value is defined only when a datagram is actually fragmented.
