Hash and Stuffing: Overlooked Factors in
Network Device Benchmarking
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Test engineers take pains to declare all factors that affect a given measurement, including intended load, packet length, test duration, and traffic orientation.  However, current benchmarking practice overlooks two factors that have a profound impact on test results.  First, existing methodologies do not require the reporting of addresses or other test traffic contents, even though these fields can affect test results.  Second, stuff bits and bytes inserted in test traffic by some link-layer technologies add significant and variable overhead, which in turn affects test results.  This document describes the effects of these factors; recommends guidelines for test traffic contents; and offers formulas for determining the probability of bit- and byte-stuffing in test traffic.

Benchmarking Methodology for Stateful
NATxy Gateways
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9693.html", target="_top", tooltip="RFC 2544 defines a benchmarking methodology for network interconnect devices.  RFC 5180 addresses IPv6 specificities, and it also provides a technology update but excludes IPv6 transition technologies.  RFC 8219 addresses IPv6 transition technologies, including stateful NAT64.  However, none of them discuss how to apply pseudorandom port numbers from RFC 4814 to any stateful NATxy (such as NAT44, NAT64, and NAT66) technologies.  This document discusses why using pseudorandom port numbers with stateful NATxy gateways is a difficult problem.  It recommends a solution that limits the port number ranges and uses two test phases (phase 1 and phase 2).  This document shows how the classic performance measurement procedures (e.g., throughput, frame loss rate, latency, etc.) can be carried out.  New performance metrics and measurement procedures are also defined for measuring the maximum connection establishment rate, connection tear-down rate, and connection tracking table capacity."];
