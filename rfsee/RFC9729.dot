The Concealed HTTP Authentication Scheme
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Most HTTP authentication schemes are probeable in the sense that it is possible for an unauthenticated client to probe whether an origin serves resources that require authentication.  It is possible for an origin to hide the fact that it requires authentication by not generating Unauthorized status codes; however, that only works with non-cryptographic authentication schemes: cryptographic signatures require a fresh nonce to be signed.  Prior to this document, there was no existing way for the origin to share such a nonce without exposing the fact that it serves resources that require authentication.  This document defines a new non-probeable cryptographic authentication scheme."];

Handling Long Lines in Content of
Internet-Drafts and RFCs
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8792.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in width-bounded text content.  One strategy, called the single backslash strategy, is based on the historical use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where line-folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character that is not a space character (' ') on the next line.  The second strategy, called the double backslash strategy, extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the continuation begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported by the first strategy.  Both strategies use a self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the original content."];

Transport Layer Security (TLS) Session
Hash and Extended Master Secret
Extension
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7627.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Transport Layer Security (TLS) master secret is not cryptographically bound to important session parameters such as the server certificate.  Consequently, it is possible for an active attacker to set up two sessions, one with a client and another with a server, such that the master secrets on the two sessions are the same.  Thereafter, any mechanism that relies on the master secret for authentication, including session resumption, becomes vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker can simply forward messages back and forth between the client and server.  This specification defines a TLS extension that contextually binds the master secret to a log of the full handshake that computes it, thus preventing such attacks."];
