Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol
(SRMP)
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRMP) is a transport protocol, intended to deliver a mix of reliable and best-effort messages in an any-to-any multicast environment, where the best-effort traffic occurs in significantly greater volume than the reliable traffic and therefore can carry sequence numbers of reliable messages for loss detection.  SRMP is intended for use in a distributed simulation application environment, where only the latest value of reliable transmission for any particular data identifier requires delivery.  SRMP has two sublayers: a bundling sublayer handling message aggregation and congestion control, and a Selectively Reliable Transport (SRT) sublayer.  Selection between reliable and best-effort messages is performed by the application.
