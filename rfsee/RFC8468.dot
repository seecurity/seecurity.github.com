This memo identifies that IPv4-IPv6 coexistence can challenge measurements within the scope of the IPPM framework.  Example use cases include, but are not limited to, IPv4-IPv6 translation, NAT, and protocol encapsulation.

In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow the traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links.
