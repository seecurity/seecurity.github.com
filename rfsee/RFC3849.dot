Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2)

HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes. HIP is based on a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication. The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. When used together with another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional encryption for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.

Resource Directory

These problems can be solved by employing an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which contains information about resources held on other servers, allowing lookups to be performed for those resources.  The input to an RD is composed of links, and the output is composed of links constructed from the information stored in the RD.  This document specifies the web interfaces that an RD supports for web servers to discover the RD and to register, maintain, look up, and remove information on resources.  Furthermore, new target attributes useful in conjunction with an RD are defined."];

An Extension for Application-Layer
Traffic Optimization (ALTO): Entity
Property Maps
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9240.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol that generalizes the concept of endpoint properties, which have been tied to IP addresses so far, to entities defined by a wide set of objects.  Further, these properties are presented as maps, similar to the network and cost maps in the base ALTO Protocol.  While supporting the endpoints and related Endpoint Property Service defined in RFC 7285, the ALTO Protocol is extended in two major directions.  First, from endpoints restricted to IP addresses to entities covering a wider and extensible set of objects; second, from properties for specific endpoints to entire entity property maps.  These extensions introduce additional features that allow entities and property values to be specific to a given information resource.  This is made possible by a generic and flexible design of entity and property types."];
