GMPLS Signaling Extensions for Shared
Mesh Protection
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9270.html", target="_top", tooltip="ITU-T Recommendation G.808.3 defines the generic aspects of a Shared Mesh Protection (SMP) mechanism, where the difference between SMP and Shared Mesh Restoration (SMR) is also identified. ITU-T Recommendation G.873.3 defines the protection switching operation and associated protocol for SMP at the Optical Data Unit (ODU) layer. RFC 7412 provides requirements for any mechanism that would be used to implement SMP in a Multi-Protocol Label Switching - Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) network. This document updates RFCs 4872 and 4873 to provide extensions for Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling to support the control of the SMP mechanism."];

Path Computation Element Communication
Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful
PCE Usage in GMPLS-Controlled Networks
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9504.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) has been extended to support stateful PCE functions where the stateful PCE maintains information about paths and resource usage within a network; however, these extensions do not cover all requirements for GMPLS networks. This document provides the extensions required for PCEP so as to enable the usage of a stateful PCE capability in GMPLS-controlled networks."];

Overview and Principles of Internet
Traffic Engineering
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9522.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the principles of traffic engineering (TE) in the Internet. The document is intended to promote better understanding of the issues surrounding traffic engineering in IP networks and the networks that support IP networking and to provide a common basis for the development of traffic-engineering capabilities for the Internet. The principles, architectures, and methodologies for performance evaluation and performance optimization of operational networks are also discussed. This work was first published as RFC 3272 in May 2002. This document obsoletes RFC 3272 by making a complete update to bring the text in line with best current practices for Internet traffic engineering and to include references to the latest relevant work in the IETF."];

Interworking of GMPLS Control and
Centralized Controller Systems
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9730.html", target="_top", tooltip="Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows each network element (NE) to perform local resource discovery, routing, and signaling in a distributed manner. The advancement of software-defined transport networking technology enables a group of NEs to be managed through centralized controller hierarchies. This helps to tackle challenges arising from multiple domains, vendors, and technologies. An example of such a centralized architecture is the Abstraction and Control of Traffic-Engineered Networks (ACTN) controller hierarchy, as described in RFC 8453. Both the distributed and centralized control planes have their respective advantages and should complement each other in the system, rather than compete. This document outlines how the GMPLS distributed control plane can work together with a centralized controller system in a transport network."];
