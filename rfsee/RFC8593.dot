Video Traffic Models for RTP Congestion
Control Evaluations
2019", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes two reference video traffic models for evaluating RTP congestion control algorithms.  The first model statistically characterizes the behavior of a live video encoder in response to changing requests on the target video rate.  The second model is trace-driven and emulates the output of actual encoded video frame sizes from a high-resolution test sequence.  Both models are designed to strike a balance between simplicity, repeatability, and authenticity in modeling the interactions between a live video traffic source and the congestion control module.  Finally, the document describes how both approaches can be combined into a hybrid model.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation
(NADA): A Unified Congestion Control
Scheme for Real-Time Media
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8698.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA), a novel congestion control scheme for interactive real-time media applications such as video conferencing.  In the proposed scheme, the sender regulates its sending rate, based on either implicit or explicit congestion signaling, in a unified approach.  The scheme can benefit from Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) markings from network nodes.  It also maintains consistent sender behavior in the absence of such markings by reacting to queuing delays and packet losses instead."];
