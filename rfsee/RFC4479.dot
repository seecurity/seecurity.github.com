2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5262.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Presence Information Document Format (PIDF) specifies the baseline XML-based format for describing presence information.  One of the characteristics of the PIDF is that the document always needs to carry all presence information available for the presentity.  In some environments where low bandwidth and high latency links can exist, it is often beneficial to limit the amount of transported information over the network.  This document introduces a new MIME type that enables transporting of either only the changed parts or the full PIDF-based presence information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Publication of Partial Presence
Information
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5264.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication describes a mechanism with which a presence user agent is able to publish presence information to a presence agent.  Using the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF), each presence publication contains full state, regardless of how much of that information has actually changed since the previous update.  As a consequence, updating a sizeable presence document with small changes bears a considerable overhead and is therefore inefficient.  Especially with low bandwidth and high latency links, this can constitute a considerable burden to the system.  This memo defines a solution that aids in reducing the impact of those constraints and increases transport efficiency by introducing a mechanism that allows for publication of partial presence information.

GEOPRIV Presence Information Data Format
Location Object (PIDF-LO) Usage
Clarification, Considerations, and
Recommendations
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5491.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) specification provides a flexible and versatile means to represent location information.  There are, however, circumstances that arise when information needs to be constrained in how it is represented.  In these circumstances, the range of options that need to be implemented are reduced.  There is growing interest in being able to use location information contained in a PIDF-LO for routing applications.  To allow successful interoperability between applications, location information needs to be normative and more tightly constrained than is currently specified in RFC 4119 (PIDF-LO).  This document makes recommendations on how to constrain, represent, and interpret locations in a PIDF-LO.  It further recommends a subset of Geography Markup Language (GML) 3.1.1 that is mandatory to implement by applications involved in location-based routing. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
