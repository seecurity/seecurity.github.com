Considerations for Transitioning Content
to IPv6
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6589.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes considerations for the transition of end-user content on the Internet to IPv6.  While this is tailored to address end-user content, which is typically web-based, many aspects of this document may be more broadly applicable to the transition to IPv6 of other applications and services.  This document explores the challenges involved in the transition to IPv6, potential migration tactics, possible migration phases, and other considerations.  The audience for this document is the Internet community generally, particularly IPv6 implementers.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Default Address Selection for Internet
Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6724.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes two algorithms, one for source address selection and one for destination address selection. The algorithms specify default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations. They do not override choices made by applications or upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the development of more advanced mechanisms for address selection. The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior. In dual-stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses -- depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice versa. Default address selection as defined in this specification applies to all IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers. This document obsoletes RFC 3484. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Architectural Considerations on
Application Features in the DNS
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6950.html", target="_top", tooltip="A number of Internet applications rely on the Domain Name System (DNS) to support their operations.  Many applications use the DNS to locate services for a domain; some, for example, transform identifiers other than domain names into formats that the DNS can process, and then fetch application data or service location data from the DNS.  Proposals incorporating sophisticated application behavior using DNS as a substrate have raised questions about the role of the DNS as an application platform.  This document explores the architectural consequences of using the DNS to implement certain application features, and it provides guidance to future application designers as to the limitations of the DNS as a substrate and the situations in which alternative designs should be considered."];
