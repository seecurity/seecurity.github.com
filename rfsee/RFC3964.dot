Security Considerations for 6to4
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The IPv6 interim mechanism 6to4 (RFC3056) uses automatic IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling to interconnect IPv6 networks.  The architecture includes 6to4 routers and 6to4 relay routers, which accept and decapsulate IPv4 protocol-41 (IPv6-in-IPv4) traffic from any node in the IPv4 internet.  This characteristic enables a number of security threats, mainly Denial of Service.  It also makes it easier for nodes to spoof IPv6 addresses.  This document discusses these issues in more detail and suggests enhancements to alleviate the problems.

6to4 Reverse DNS Delegation
Specification

The mechanism is based on a conventional DNS delegation service interface, allowing the service client to enter the details of a number of DNS servers for the delegated domain.  In the context of a 6to4 reverse delegation, the client is primarily authenticated by its source address used in the delegation request, and is authorized to use the function if its IPv6 address prefix corresponds to an address from within the requested 6to4 delegation address block.

IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4

Like 6to4, it utilizes stateless IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation in order to transit IPv4-only network infrastructure.  Unlike 6to4, a 6rd service provider uses an IPv6 prefix of its own in place of the fixed 6to4 prefix.  A service provider has used this mechanism for its own IPv6 rapid deployment: five weeks from first exposure to 6rd principles to more than 1,500,000 residential sites being provided native IPv6, under the only condition that they activate it.

The control protocol (TSP) is used by the tunnel client to negotiate the tunnel with the broker.  A mobile node implementing TSP can be connected to both IPv4 and IPv6 networks whether it is on IPv4 only, IPv4 behind a NAT, or on IPv6 only.  A tunnel broker may terminate the tunnels on remote tunnel servers or on itself.  This document describes the TSP within the model of the tunnel broker model.
