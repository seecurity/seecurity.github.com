Mobility Services Transport: Problem
Statement
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="There are ongoing activities in the networking community to develop solutions that aid in IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneous wired and wireless access systems including, but not limited to, IEEE 802.21.  Intelligent access selection, taking into account link-layer attributes, requires the delivery of a variety of different information types to the terminal from different sources within the network and vice-versa.  The protocol requirements for this signalling have both transport and security issues that must be considered.  The signalling must not be constrained to specific link types, so there is at least a common component to the signalling problem, which is within the scope of the IETF.  This document presents a problem statement for this core problem.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

IEEE 802.21 Mobility Services Framework
Design (MSFD)
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5677.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a mobility services framework design (MSFD) for the IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) protocol that addresses identified issues associated with the transport of MIH messages.  The document also describes mechanisms for Mobility Services (MoS) discovery and transport-layer mechanisms for the reliable delivery of MIH messages.  This document does not provide mechanisms for securing the communication between a mobile node (MN) and the Mobility Server.  Instead, it is assumed that either lower-layer (e.g., link-layer) security mechanisms or overall system-specific proprietary security solutions are used. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Locating IEEE 802.21 Mobility Services
Using DNS
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5679.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines application service tags that allow service location without relying on rigid domain naming conventions, and DNS procedures for discovering servers that provide IEEE 802.21-defined Mobility Services.  Such Mobility Services are used to assist a Mobile Node (MN) supporting IEEE 802.21, in handover preparation (network discovery) and handover decision (network selection).  The services addressed by this document are the Media Independent Handover Services defined in IEEE 802.21. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
