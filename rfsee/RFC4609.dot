Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse
Mode (PIM-SM) Multicast Routing Security
Issues and Enhancements
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This memo describes security threats for the larger (intra-domain or inter-domain) multicast routing infrastructures.  Only Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is analyzed, in its three main operational modes: the traditional Any-Source Multicast (ASM) model, the source-specific multicast (SSM) model, and the ASM model enhanced by the Embedded Rendezvous Point (Embedded-RP) group-to-RP mapping mechanism.  This memo also describes enhancements to the protocol operations that mitigate the identified threats.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Authentication and Confidentiality in
Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse
Mode (PIM-SM) Link-Local Messages
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5796.html", target="_top", tooltip="RFC 4601 mandates the use of IPsec to ensure authentication of the link-local messages in the Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) routing protocol.  This document specifies mechanisms to authenticate the PIM-SM link-local messages using the IP security (IPsec) Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) or (optionally) the Authentication Header (AH).  It specifies optional mechanisms to provide confidentiality using the ESP.  Manual keying is specified as the mandatory and default group key management solution.  To deal with issues of scalability and security that exist with manual keying, optional support for an automated group key management mechanism is provided.  However, the procedures for implementing automated group key management are left to other documents.  This document updates RFC 4601. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

TreeDN: Tree-Based Content Delivery

Audiences

TreeDN is a tree-based Content Delivery Network (CDN) architecture designed to address the distinctive scaling challenges of live streaming to mass audiences.  TreeDN enables operators to offer Replication-as-a-Service (RaaS) at a fraction of the cost of traditional, unicast-based CDNs -- in some cases, at no additional cost to the infrastructure.  In addition to efficiently utilizing network resources to deliver existing multi-destination traffic, this architecture also enables new types of content and use cases that previously were not possible or economically viable using traditional CDN approaches.  Finally, TreeDN is a decentralized architecture and a democratizing technology that makes content distribution more accessible to more people by dramatically reducing the costs of replication."];
