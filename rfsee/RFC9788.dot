Header Protection for Cryptographically
Protected Email
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="S/MIME version 3.1 introduced a mechanism to provide end-to-end cryptographic protection of email message headers. However, few implementations generate messages using this mechanism, and several legacy implementations have revealed rendering or security issues when handling such a message. This document updates the S/MIME specification (RFC 8551) to offer a different mechanism that provides the same cryptographic protections but with fewer downsides when handled by legacy clients. Furthermore, it offers more explicit usability, privacy, and security guidance for clients when generating or handling email messages with cryptographic protection of message headers. The Header Protection scheme defined here is also applicable to messages with PGP/MIME (Pretty Good Privacy with MIME) cryptographic protections.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
Signatures
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6376.html", target="_top", tooltip="DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a person, role, or organization that owns the signing domain to claim some responsibility for a message by associating the domain with the message. This can be an author's organization, an operational relay, or one of their agents. DKIM separates the question of the identity of the Signer of the message from the purported author of the message. Assertion of responsibility is validated through a cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit from author to recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive change to the message content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.

Domain-based Message Authentication,

2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7489.html", target="_top", tooltip="Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating organization can express domain-level policies and preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting, that a mail-receiving organization can use to improve mail handling. Originators of Internet Mail need to be able to associate reliable and authenticated domain identifiers with messages, communicate policies about messages that use those identifiers, and report about mail using those identifiers. These abilities have several benefits: Receivers can provide feedback to Domain Owners about the use of their domains; this feedback can provide valuable insight about the management of internal operations and the presence of external domain name abuse. DMARC does not produce or encourage elevated delivery privilege of authenticated email. DMARC is a mechanism for policy distribution that enables increasingly strict handling of messages that fail authentication checks, ranging from no action, through altered delivery, up to message rejection."];
