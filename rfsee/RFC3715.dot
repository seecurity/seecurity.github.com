IPsec-Network Address Translation (NAT)
Compatibility Requirements

Perhaps the most common use of IPsec is in providing virtual private networking capabilities.

Today, NATs are widely deployed in home gateways, as well as in other locations likely to be used by telecommuters, such as hotels.

NAT and Firewall Traversal Issues of

Communication
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5207.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) changes the way in which two Internet hosts communicate.  One key advantage over other schemes is that HIP does not require modifications to the traditional network- layer functionality of the Internet, i.e., its routers.  In the current Internet, however, many devices other than routers modify the traditional network-layer behavior of the Internet.  These middleboxes are intermediary devices that perform functions other than the standard functions of an IP router on the datagram path between source and destination hosts.  Whereas some types of middleboxes may not interfere with HIP at all, others can affect some aspects of HIP communication, and others can render HIP communication impossible.  This document discusses the problems associated with HIP communication across network paths that include specific types of middleboxes, namely, network address translators and firewalls.

Issues with IP Address Sharing

Several possible solutions to this problem are now emerging based around the idea of shared IPv4 addressing. These solutions give rise to a number of issues, and this memo identifies those common to all such address sharing approaches. Such issues include application failures, additional service monitoring complexity, new security vulnerabilities, and so on. Solution-specific discussions are out of scope.

The Address plus Port (A+P) Approach to
the IPv4 Address Shortage
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6346.html", target="_top", tooltip="We are facing the exhaustion of the IANA IPv4 free IP address pool. Unfortunately, IPv6 is not yet deployed widely enough to fully replace IPv4, and it is unrealistic to expect that this is going to change before the depletion of IPv4 addresses. Letting hosts seamlessly communicate in an IPv4 world without assigning a unique globally routable IPv4 address to each of them is a challenging problem. This document proposes an IPv4 address sharing scheme, treating some of the port number bits as part of an extended IPv4 address (Address plus Port, or A+P). Instead of assigning a single IPv4 address to a single customer device, we propose to extend the address field by using bits from the port number range in the TCP/UDP header as additional endpoint identifiers, thus leaving a reduced range of ports available to applications. This means assigning the same IPv4 address to multiple clients (e.g., Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), mobile phones), each with its assigned port range. In the face of IPv4 address exhaustion, the need for addresses is stronger than the need to be able to address thousands of applications on a single host. If address translation is needed, the end-user should be in control of the translation process -- not some smart boxes in the core.
