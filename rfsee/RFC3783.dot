Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI)
Command Ordering Considerations with
iSCSI
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) is a Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) transport protocol designed to run on top of TCP.  The iSCSI session abstraction is equivalent to the classic SCSI I_T nexus, which represents the logical relationship between an Initiator and a Target (I and T) required in order to communicate via the SCSI family of protocols.  The iSCSI session provides an ordered command delivery from the SCSI initiator to the SCSI target.  This document goes into the design considerations that led to the iSCSI session model as it is defined today, relates the SCSI command ordering features defined in T10 specifications to the iSCSI concepts, and finally provides guidance to system designers on how true command ordering solutions can be built based on iSCSI.

(iSCSI) Protocol (Consolidated)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7143.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a transport protocol for SCSI that works on top of TCP. The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with the standardized SCSI Architecture Model (SAM-2). RFC 3720 defined the original iSCSI protocol. RFC 3721 discusses iSCSI naming examples and discovery techniques. Subsequently, RFC 3980 added an additional naming format to the iSCSI protocol. RFC 4850 followed up by adding a new public extension key to iSCSI. RFC 5048 offered a number of clarifications as well as a few improvements and corrections to the original iSCSI protocol. This document obsoletes RFCs 3720, 3980, 4850, and 5048 by consolidating them into a single document and making additional updates to the consolidated specification. This document also updates RFC 3721. The text in this document thus supersedes the text in all the noted RFCs wherever there is a difference in semantics."];
