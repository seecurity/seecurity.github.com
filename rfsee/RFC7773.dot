An overview of this approach and model is provided as an introduction.  The X.509 v3 certificate format is described in detail, with additional information regarding the format and semantics of Internet name forms.  Standard certificate extensions are described and two Internet-specific extensions are defined.  A set of required certificate extensions is specified.  The X.509 v2 CRL format is described in detail along with standard and Internet-specific extensions.  An algorithm for X.509 certification path validation is described.  An ASN.1 module and examples are provided in the appendices. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Internet X.509 Public Key
Infrastructure: Qualified Certificates
Profile
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3739.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document forms a certificate profile, based on RFC 3280, for identity certificates issued to natural persons.  The profile defines specific conventions for certificates that are qualified within a defined legal framework, named Qualified Certificates.  However, the profile does not define any legal requirements for such Qualified Certificates.  The goal of this document is to define a certificate profile that supports the issuance of Qualified Certificates independent of local legal requirements.  The profile is however not limited to Qualified Certificates and further profiling may facilitate specific local needs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
