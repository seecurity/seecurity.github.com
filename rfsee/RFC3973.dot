It defines techniques for multicast duplicate packet detection (DPD), to be applied in the forwarding process, for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol use.  This document also specifies optional mechanisms for using reduced relay sets to achieve more efficient multicast data distribution within a mesh topology as compared to Classic Flooding.  Interactions with other protocols, such as use of information provided by concurrently running unicast routing protocols or interaction with other multicast protocols, as well as multiple deployment approaches are also described.  Distributed algorithms for selecting reduced relay sets and related discussion are provided in the appendices.  Basic issues relating to the operation of multicast MANET border routers are discussed, but ongoing work remains in this area and is beyond the scope of this document.

Protocol Independent Multicast Equal-

2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6754.html", target="_top", tooltip="A Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) router uses the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) procedure to select an upstream interface and router in order to build forwarding state.

Such algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic among the ECMPs according to administrative metrics.  This usually leads to inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.  This document introduces the ECMP Redirect, a mechanism to improve the RPF procedure over ECMPs.  It allows ECMP selection to be based on administratively selected metrics, such as data transmission delays, path preferences, and routing metrics. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
