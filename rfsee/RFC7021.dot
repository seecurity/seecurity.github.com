Assessing the Impact of Carrier-Grade
NAT on Network Applications
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="NAT444 is an IPv4 extension technology being considered by Service Providers as a means to continue offering IPv4 service to customers while transitioning to IPv6.  This technology adds an extra Carrier- Grade NAT (CGN) in the Service Provider network, often resulting in two NATs.  CableLabs, Time Warner Cable, and Rogers Communications independently tested the impacts of NAT444 on many popular Internet services using a variety of test scenarios, network topologies, and vendor equipment.  This document identifies areas where adding a second layer of NAT disrupts the communication channel for common Internet applications.

Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through
Network Address Translations (NATs)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4380.html", target="_top", tooltip="We propose here a service that enables nodes located behind one or more IPv4 Network Address Translations (NATs) to obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling packets over UDP; we call this the Teredo service.  Running the service requires the help of Teredo servers and Teredo relays.  The Teredo servers are stateless, and only have to manage a small fraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the Teredo relays act as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the native IPv6 Internet.  The relays can also provide interoperability with hosts using other transition mechanisms such as 6to4. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Issues with IP Address Sharing
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6269.html", target="_top", tooltip="The completion of IPv4 address allocations from IANA and the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) is causing service providers around the world to question how they will continue providing IPv4 connectivity service to their subscribers when there are no longer sufficient IPv4 addresses to allocate them one per subscriber. Several possible solutions to this problem are now emerging based around the idea of shared IPv4 addressing. These solutions give rise to a number of issues, and this memo identifies those common to all such address sharing approaches. Such issues include application failures, additional service monitoring complexity, new security vulnerabilities, and so on. Solution-specific discussions are out of scope. Deploying IPv6 is the only perennial way to ease pressure on the public IPv4 address pool without the need for address sharing mechanisms that give rise to the issues identified herein.

An Incremental Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN)
for IPv6 Transition
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6264.html", target="_top", tooltip="Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected. As IPv4 address exhaustion approaches, IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues become more critical and less tractable. Host-based transition mechanisms used in dual-stack environments cannot meet all transition requirements. Most end users are not sufficiently expert to configure or maintain host-based transition mechanisms. Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) devices with integrated transition mechanisms can reduce the operational changes required during the IPv4 to IPv6 migration or coexistence period. This document proposes an incremental CGN approach for IPv6 transition. It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6 hosts and IPv4 access services for IPv4 hosts while leaving much of a legacy ISP network unchanged during the initial stage of IPv4 to IPv6 migration. Unlike CGN alone, incremental CGN also supports and encourages smooth transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks. An integrated configurable CGN device and an adaptive home gateway (HG) device are described. Both are reusable during different transition phases, avoiding multiple upgrades. This enables IPv6 migration to be incrementally achieved according to real user requirements.

Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) Deployment with
BGP/MPLS IP VPNs
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7289.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a framework to integrate a Network Address Translation (NAT) layer into an operator's network to function as a Carrier-Grade NAT (also known as CGN or Large-Scale NAT).  The CGN infrastructure will often form a NAT444 environment as the subscriber home network will likely also maintain a subscriber-side NAT function.  Exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool is a major driver compelling some operators to implement CGN.  Although operators may wish to deploy IPv6 to strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near- term needs may not be satisfied with an IPv6 deployment alone.  This document provides a practical integration model that allows the CGN platform to be integrated into the network, meeting the connectivity needs of the subscriber while being mindful of not disrupting existing services and meeting the technical challenges that CGN brings.  The model included in this document utilizes BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, which allow for virtual routing separation, helping ease the CGN's impact on the network.  This document does not intend to defend the merits of CGN."];

Deterministic Address Mapping to Reduce
Logging in Carrier-Grade NAT Deployments
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7422.html", target="_top", tooltip="In some instances, Service Providers (SPs) have a legal logging requirement to be able to map a subscriber's inside address with the address used on the public Internet (e.g., for abuse response).  Unfortunately, many logging solutions for Carrier-Grade NATs (CGNs) require active logging of dynamic translations.  CGN port assignments are often per connection, but they could optionally use port ranges.  Research indicates that per-connection logging is not scalable in many residential broadband services.  This document suggests a way to manage CGN translations in such a way as to significantly reduce the amount of logging required while providing traceability for abuse response.  IPv6 is, of course, the preferred solution.  While deployment is in progress, SPs are forced by business imperatives to maintain support for IPv4.  This note addresses the IPv4 part of the network when a CGN solution is in use."];

Planning for Protocol Adoption and

Many protocols and technologies were not designed to enable smooth transition to alternatives or to easily deploy extensions; thus, some transitions, such as the introduction of IPv6, have been difficult.  This document attempts to summarize some basic principles to enable future transitions, and it also summarizes what makes for a good transition plan."];
