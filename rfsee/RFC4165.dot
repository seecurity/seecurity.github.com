Signaling System 7 (SS7) Message

This protocol would be used between SS7 Signaling Points using the MTP Level 3 protocol.  The SS7 Signaling Points may also use standard SS7 links using the SS7 MTP Level 2 to provide transport of MTP Level 3 signaling messages.  The protocol operates in a manner similar to MTP Level 2 so as to provide peer-to-peer communication between SS7 endpoints. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
