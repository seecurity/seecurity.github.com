For administrative or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to divide one Internet network into several subnets, instead of acquiring a set of Internet network numbers.  This memo specifies procedures for the use of subnets.  These procedures are for hosts (e.g., workstations).  The procedures used in and between subnet gateways are not fully described.  Important motivation and background information for a subnetting standard is provided in RFC-940.  This RFC specifies a protocol for the ARPA-Internet community.  If subnetting is implemented it is strongly recommended that these procedures be followed."];
