Recommendations for Transport-Protocol
Port Randomization
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="During the last few years, awareness has been raised about a number of blind attacks that can be performed against the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and similar protocols.  The consequences of these attacks range from throughput reduction to broken connections or data corruption.  These attacks rely on the attacker's ability to guess or know the five-tuple (Protocol, Source Address, Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port) that identifies the transport protocol instance to be attacked.  This document describes a number of simple and efficient methods for the selection of the client port number, such that the possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced.  While this is not a replacement for cryptographic methods for protecting the transport-protocol instance, the aforementioned port selection algorithms provide improved security with very little effort and without any key management overhead.  The algorithms described in this document are local policies that may be incrementally deployed and that do not violate the specifications of any of the transport protocols that may benefit from them, such as TCP, UDP, UDP-lite, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), and RTP (provided that the RTP application explicitly signals the RTP and RTCP port numbers).

Defending TCP Against Spoofing Attacks
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4953.html", target="_top", tooltip="Recent analysis of potential attacks on core Internet infrastructure indicates an increased vulnerability of TCP connections to spurious resets (RSTs), sent with forged IP source addresses (spoofing).  TCP has always been susceptible to such RST spoofing attacks, which were indirectly protected by checking that the RST sequence number was inside the current receive window, as well as via the obfuscation of TCP endpoint and port numbers.  For pairs of well-known endpoints often over predictable port pairs, such as BGP or between web servers and well-known large-scale caches, increases in the path bandwidth-delay product of a connection have sufficiently increased the receive window space that off-path third parties can brute-force generate a viable RST sequence number.  The susceptibility to attack increases with the square of the bandwidth, and thus presents a significant vulnerability for recent high-speed networks.  This document addresses this vulnerability, discussing proposed solutions at the transport level and their inherent challenges, as well as existing network level solutions and the feasibility of their deployment.

TCP-AO is compatible with either a static Master Key Tuple (MKT) configuration or an external, out-of-band MKT management mechanism; in either case, TCP-AO also protects connections when using the same MKT across repeated instances of a connection, using traffic keys derived from the MKT, and coordinates MKT changes between endpoints.  The result is intended to support current infrastructure uses of TCP MD5, such as to protect long-lived connections (as used, e.g., in BGP and LDP), and to support a larger set of MACs with minimal other system and operational changes.  TCP-AO uses a different option identifier than TCP MD5, even though TCP-AO and TCP MD5 are never permitted to be used simultaneously.

Some of these modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets and therefore require the use of a well-known port as the local port.  However, in the case of NTP modes where the use of a well-known port is not required, employing such a well-known port unnecessarily facilitates the ability of attackers to perform blind/off-path attacks.  This document formally updates RFC 5905, recommending the use of transport-protocol ephemeral port randomization for those modes where use of the NTP well-known port is not required."];

On the Generation of Transient Numeric
Identifiers

Subsequently, it provides advice on possible algorithms that could be employed to satisfy the interoperability requirements of each identifier category while minimizing the negative security and privacy implications, thus providing guidance to protocol designers and protocol implementers.  Finally, it describes a number of algorithms that have been employed in real implementations to generate transient numeric identifiers and analyzes their security and privacy properties.

Security Considerations for Transient
Numeric Identifiers Employed in Network
Protocols
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9416.html", target="_top", tooltip="Poor selection of transient numerical identifiers in protocols such as the TCP/IP suite has historically led to a number of attacks on implementations, ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) or data injection to information leakages that can be exploited by pervasive monitoring.  Due diligence in the specification of transient numeric identifiers is required even when cryptographic techniques are employed, since these techniques might not mitigate all the associated issues.  This document formally updates RFC 3552, incorporating requirements for transient numeric identifiers, to prevent flaws in future protocols and implementations."];

YANG Groupings for TCP Clients and TCP
Servers
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9643.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents three YANG 1.1 modules to support the configuration of TCP clients and TCP servers.  The modules include basic parameters of a TCP connection relevant for client or server applications, as well as client configuration required for traversing proxies.  The data models defined by these modules may be used directly (e.g., to define a specific TCP client or TCP server) or in conjunction with the configuration defined for higher level protocols that depend on TCP (e.g., SSH, TLS, etc.).  Examples of higher level protocol configuration designed to be used in conjunction with this configuration are in RFCs 9644 and 9645."];
