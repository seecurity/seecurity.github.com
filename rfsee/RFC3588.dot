Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
Proxy Approaches
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5945.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) can be used to make end-to- end resource reservations in an IP network in order to guarantee the quality of service required by certain flows.  RSVP assumes that both the data sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling.  Yet, there are use cases where resource reservation is required, but the receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable.  This document presents RSVP proxy behaviors allowing RSVP routers to initiate or terminate RSVP signaling on behalf of a receiver or a sender that is not RSVP-capable.  This allows resource reservations to be established on a critical subset of the end-to-end path.  This document reviews conceptual approaches for deploying RSVP proxies and discusses how RSVP reservations can be synchronized with application requirements, despite the sender, receiver, or both not participating in RSVP.  This document also points out where extensions to RSVP (or to other protocols) may be needed for deployment of a given RSVP proxy approach.  However, such extensions are outside the scope of this document.  Finally, practical use cases for RSVP proxy are described.

Use of Device Identity in HTTP-Enabled
Location Delivery (HELD)
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6155.html", target="_top", tooltip="When a Location Information Server receives a request for location information (using the locationRequest message), described in the base HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) specification, it uses the source IP address of the arriving message as a pointer to the location determination process. This is sufficient in environments where the location of a Device can be determined based on its IP address. Two additional use cases are addressed by this document. In the first, location configuration requires additional or alternative identifiers from the source IP address provided in the request. In the second, an entity other than the Device requests the location of the Device. This document extends the HELD protocol to allow the location request message to carry Device identifiers. Privacy and security considerations describe the conditions where requests containing identifiers are permitted. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node from the DHCPv6 server.  The access router may next do stateless or stateful address allocation to the mobile node, e.g., with a Router Advertisement or using DHCP.

Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1

TLS version 1.2 became the recommended version for IETF protocols in 2008 (subsequently being obsoleted by TLS version 1.3 in 2018), providing sufficient time to transition away from older versions. Removing support for older versions from implementations reduces the attack surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines library and product maintenance. This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC 4347) but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1.
