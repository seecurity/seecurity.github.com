These features require the ingress router of the P2MP tunnel to allocate an upstream-assigned MPLS label for each VPN or for each BD.  A packet sent on a P2MP tunnel then carries the label that is mapped to its VPN or BD (in some cases, a distinct upstream-assigned label is needed for each flow.) Since each ingress router allocates labels independently, with no coordination among the ingress routers, the egress routers may need to keep track of a large number of labels.  The number of labels may need to be as large as, or larger than, the product of the number of ingress routers times the number of VPNs or BDs.

(OISM) Forwarding
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9625.html", target="_top", tooltip="Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides a service that allows a single Local Area Network (LAN), comprising a single IP subnet, to be divided into multiple segments.  Each segment may be located at a different site, and the segments are interconnected by an IP or MPLS backbone.  Intra-subnet traffic (either unicast or multicast) always appears to the end users to be bridged, even when it is actually carried over the IP or MPLS backbone.  When a single tenant owns multiple such LANs, EVPN also allows IP unicast traffic to be routed between those LANs.  This document specifies new procedures that allow inter-subnet IP multicast traffic to be routed among the LANs of a given tenant while still making intra-subnet IP multicast traffic appear to be bridged.  These procedures can provide optimal routing of the inter-subnet multicast traffic and do not require any such traffic to egress a given router and then ingress that same router.  These procedures also accommodate IP multicast traffic that originates or is destined to be external to the EVPN domain."];

Advertising Segment Routing Policies in
BGP
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9830.html", target="_top", tooltip="A Segment Routing (SR) Policy is an ordered list of segments (also referred to as instructions) that define a source-routed policy. An SR Policy consists of one or more Candidate Paths (CPs), each comprising one or more segment lists. A headend can be provisioned with these CPs using various mechanisms such as Command-Line Interface (CLI), Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP), or BGP. This document specifies how BGP can be used to distribute SR Policy CPs. It introduces a BGP SAFI for advertising a CP of an SR Policy and defines sub-TLVs for the Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute to signal information related to these CPs. Furthermore, this document updates RFC 9012 by extending the Color Extended Community to support additional steering modes over SR Policy."];

BGP Classful Transport Planes
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9832.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a mechanism referred to as Intent-Driven Service Mapping. The mechanism uses BGP to express Intent-based association of overlay routes with underlay routes having specific Traffic Engineering (TE) characteristics satisfying a certain Service Level Agreement (SLA). This is achieved by defining new constructs to group underlay routes with sufficiently similar TE characteristics into identifiable classes (called Transport Classes or TCs), that overlay routes use as an ordered set to resolve reachability (Resolution Schemes) towards service endpoints. These constructs can be used, for example, to realize the IETF Network Slice defined in the TEAS Network Slices framework (RFC 9543). Additionally, this document specifies protocol procedures for BGP that enable dissemination of service mapping information in a network that may span multiple cooperating administrative domains. These domains may be administered either by the same provider or by closely coordinating providers. A new BGP address family that leverages the procedures described in RFC 4364 (BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)) and follows the NLRI encoding described in RFC 8277 (Using BGP to Bind MPLS Labels to Address Prefixes) is defined to enable each advertised underlay route to be identified by its class. This new address family is called BGP Classful Transport (or BGP CT)."];

BGP Color-Aware Routing (CAR)
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9871.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a BGP-based routing solution to establish end-to-end intent-aware paths across a multi-domain transport network. The transport network can span multiple service provider and customer network domains. The BGP intent-aware paths can be used to steer traffic flows for service routes that need a specific intent. This solution is called BGP Color-Aware Routing (BGP CAR). This document describes the routing framework and BGP extensions to enable intent-aware routing using the BGP CAR solution. The solution defines two new BGP SAFIs (BGP CAR SAFI and BGP VPN CAR SAFI) for IPv4 and IPv6. It also defines an extensible Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) model for both SAFIs that allows multiple NLRI types to be defined for different use cases. Each type of NLRI contains key and TLV-based non-key fields for efficient encoding of different per-prefix information. This specification defines two NLRI types: Color-Aware Route NLRI and IP Prefix NLRI. It defines non-key TLV types for the MPLS label stack, SR-MPLS label index, and Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) Segment Identifiers (SIDs). This solution also defines a new Local Color Mapping (LCM) Extended Community."];
