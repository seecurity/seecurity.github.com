Identity Selection Hints for the

This document defines a mechanism that allows an access network to provide identity selection hints to an EAP peer -- the end of the link that responds to the authenticator. The purpose is to assist the EAP peer in selecting an appropriate Network Access Identifier (NAI). This is useful in situations where the peer does not receive a lower-layer indication of what network it is connecting to, or when there is no direct roaming relationship between the access network and the peer's home network. In the latter case, authentication is typically accomplished via a mediating network such as a roaming consortium or broker. The mechanism defined in this document is limited in its scalability. It is intended for access networks that have a small to moderate number of direct roaming partners. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Therefore, this application has been carefully designed to ease the burden of protocol conversion between RADIUS and Diameter. This is achieved by including the RADIUS attribute space to eliminate the need to perform many attribute translations. The interactions between Diameter applications and RADIUS specified in this document are to be applied to all Diameter applications. In this sense, this document extends the Base Diameter protocol.
