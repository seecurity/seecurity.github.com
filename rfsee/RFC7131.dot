An Extension to the Session Initiation

Information

This capability enables many enhanced services by providing the information as to how and why a SIP request arrives at a specific application or user.  This document defines an optional SIP header field, History-Info, for capturing the history information in requests.  The document also defines SIP header field parameters for the History-Info and Contact header fields to tag the method by which the target of a request is determined.  In addition, this specification defines a value for the Privacy header field that directs the anonymization of values in the History-Info header field.  This document obsoletes RFC 4244."];

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
and Spam

Unfortunately, spam is not limited to email.  It can affect any system that enables user-to-user communications.  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) defines a system for user-to- user multimedia communications.  Therefore, it is susceptible to spam, just as email is.  In this document, we analyze the problem of spam in SIP.  We first identify the ways in which the problem is the same and the ways in which it is different from email.  We then examine the various possible solutions that have been discussed for email and consider their applicability to SIP.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
