Use of OSI IS-IS for routing in TCP/IP

This allows a single routing protocol to be used to support pure IP environments, pure OSI environments, and dual environments.

Routing IPv6 with IS-IS

Using this method, one can route IPv6 along with IPv4 and OSI using a single intra-domain routing protocol. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
