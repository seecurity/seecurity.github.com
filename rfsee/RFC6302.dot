Issues with IP Address Sharing
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6269.html", target="_top", tooltip="The completion of IPv4 address allocations from IANA and the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) is causing service providers around the world to question how they will continue providing IPv4 connectivity service to their subscribers when there are no longer sufficient IPv4 addresses to allocate them one per subscriber. Several possible solutions to this problem are now emerging based around the idea of shared IPv4 addressing. These solutions give rise to a number of issues, and this memo identifies those common to all such address sharing approaches. Such issues include application failures, additional service monitoring complexity, new security vulnerabilities, and so on. Solution-specific discussions are out of scope. Deploying IPv6 is the only perennial way to ease pressure on the public IPv4 address pool without the need for address sharing mechanisms that give rise to the issues identified herein.

NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family.  NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs.  It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not required.

Deterministic Address Mapping to Reduce
Logging in Carrier-Grade NAT Deployments
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7422.html", target="_top", tooltip="In some instances, Service Providers (SPs) have a legal logging requirement to be able to map a subscriber's inside address with the address used on the public Internet (e.g., for abuse response).  Unfortunately, many logging solutions for Carrier-Grade NATs (CGNs) require active logging of dynamic translations.  CGN port assignments are often per connection, but they could optionally use port ranges.  Research indicates that per-connection logging is not scalable in many residential broadband services.  This document suggests a way to manage CGN translations in such a way as to significantly reduce the amount of logging required while providing traceability for abuse response.  IPv6 is, of course, the preferred solution.  While deployment is in progress, SPs are forced by business imperatives to maintain support for IPv4.  This note addresses the IPv4 part of the network when a CGN solution is in use."];

Since there is no standard way of logging this information, different NAT devices use proprietary formats; hence, it is difficult to expect consistent behavior.
