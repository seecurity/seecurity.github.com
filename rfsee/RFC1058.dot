Probabilistic Routing Protocol for

2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6693.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised. This document defines PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity. PRoPHET is a variant of the epidemic routing protocol for intermittently connected networks that operates by pruning the epidemic distribution tree to minimize resource usage while still attempting to achieve the \%best-case routing capabilities of epidemic routing. It is intended for use in sparse mesh networks where there is no guarantee that a fully connected path between the source and destination exists at any time, rendering traditional routing protocols unable to deliver messages between hosts. These networks are examples of networks where there is a disparity between the latency requirements of applications and the capabilities of the underlying network (networks often referred to as delay and disruption tolerant). The document presents an architectural overview followed by the protocol specification. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

This document specifies a method by which member RBridges (also referred to as Routing Bridges or TRILL switches) in an active-active edge RBridge group use their own nicknames as ingress RBridge nicknames to encapsulate frames from attached end systems. Thus, remote edge RBridges (who are not in the group) will see one host Media Access Control (MAC) address being associated with the multiple RBridges in the group. Such remote edge RBridges are required to maintain all those associations (i.e., MAC attachments) and to not flip-flop among them (as would occur prior to the implementation of this specification). The design goals of this specification are discussed herein."];
