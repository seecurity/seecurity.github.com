An Attribute for Statement of Possession
of a Private Key
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies an attribute for a statement of possession of a private key by a certificate subject.  As part of X.509 certificate enrollment, a Certification Authority (CA) typically demands proof that the subject possesses the private key that corresponds to the to-be-certified public key.  In some cases, a CA might accept a signed statement from the certificate subject.  For example, when a certificate subject needs separate certificates for signature and key establishment, a statement that can be validated with the previously issued signature certificate for the same subject might be adequate for subsequent issuance of the key establishment certificate.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

An overview of this approach and model is provided as an introduction.  The X.509 v3 certificate format is described in detail, with additional information regarding the format and semantics of Internet name forms.  Standard certificate extensions are described and two Internet-specific extensions are defined.  A set of required certificate extensions is specified.  The X.509 v2 CRL format is described in detail along with standard and Internet-specific extensions.  An algorithm for X.509 certification path validation is described.  An ASN.1 module and examples are provided in the appendices. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
