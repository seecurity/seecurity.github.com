GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Ethernet
Operations, Administration, and
Maintenance (OAM) Configuration
2014", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The work related to GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching (GELS) extended GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the establishment of Ethernet Label Switching Paths (LSPs).  IEEE Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) specifies an adjunct Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) flow to check connectivity in Ethernet networks.  CFM can also be used with Ethernet LSPs for fault detection and triggering recovery mechanisms.  The ITU-T Y.1731 specification builds on CFM and specifies additional OAM mechanisms, including Performance Monitoring, for Ethernet networks.  This document specifies extensions of the GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol to support the setup of the associated Ethernet OAM entities of Ethernet LSPs and defines the Ethernet technology-specific TLVs based on the GMPLS OAM Configuration Framework.  This document supports, but does not modify, the IEEE and ITU-T OAM mechanisms."];

Switching Architecture and Framework
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5828.html", target="_top", tooltip="There has been significant recent work in increasing the capabilities of Ethernet switches and Ethernet forwarding models.  As a consequence, the role of Ethernet is rapidly expanding into transport networks that previously were the domain of other technologies such as Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).  This document defines an architecture and framework for a Generalized- MPLS-based control plane for Ethernet in this transport network capacity.  GMPLS has already been specified for similar technologies.  Some additional extensions to the GMPLS control plane are needed, and this document provides a framework for these extensions.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

In certain technologies, OAM entities are inherently established once the connection is set up, while other technologies require extra configuration to establish and configure OAM entities.
