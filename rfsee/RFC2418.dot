Considerations for Having a Successful
Bar BOF Side Meeting

IETF meetings are a convenient place for such groups to hold informal get-togethers to discuss and develop their ideas.

During recent IETF meetings, many such bar BOF get-togethers have been organized and moderated in ways that made them increasingly indistinguishable from official IETF BOFs or sometimes even IETF working group meetings. This document argues that this recent trend is not helpful in reaching the ultimate goal of many of these get-togethers, i.e., to efficiently discuss and develop ideas for new IETF work. It encourages the organizers to consider the benefits of holding them in much less formal settings and to also consider alternative means to develop their ideas.
