Managing Client-Initiated Connections in
the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5626.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to initiate TCP connections or to send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User Agents in order to deliver requests.  However, in a large number of real deployments, many practical considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs) or the use of TLS with server-provided certificates, prevent servers from connecting to User Agents in this way.  This specification defines behaviors for User Agents, registrars, and proxy servers that allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent.  It also defines keep-alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple connections from the User Agent to its registrar. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Media Feature Tag for MIME Application
Subtypes
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5688.html", target="_top", tooltip="The caller preferences specification for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows a caller to express preferences that the call be routed to a User Agent (UA) with particular capabilities.  Similarly, a specification exists to allow a UA to indicate its capabilities in a registration.  Amongst those capabilities are the type of media streams the agent supports, described as top-level MIME types.  The 'application' MIME type is used to describe a broad range of stream types, and it provides insufficient granularity as a capability.  This specification allows a UA to indicate which application subtypes the agent supports. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

SIP entities that are represented by the URI of the SIP Contact header field can convey media feature tags in the Contact header field to indicate support of features and capabilities.

The Session Recording Protocol specifies the use of SIP, SDP, and RTP to establish a Recording Session (RS) between the Session Recording Client (SRC), which is on the path of the CS, and a Session Recording Server (SRS) at the recording device.  This document considers only active recording, where the SRC purposefully streams media to an SRS and all participating user agents (UAs) are notified of the recording.  Passive recording, where a recording device detects media directly from the network (e.g., using port-mirroring techniques), is outside the scope of this document.  In addition, lawful intercept is outside the scope of this document."];
