A Common API for Transparent Hybrid
Multicast
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Group communication services exist in a large variety of flavors and technical implementations at different protocol layers.  Multicast data distribution is most efficiently performed on the lowest available layer, but a heterogeneous deployment status of multicast technologies throughout the Internet requires an adaptive service binding at runtime.  Today, it is difficult to write an application that runs everywhere and at the same time makes use of the most efficient multicast service available in the network.  Facing robustness requirements, developers are frequently forced to use a stable upper-layer protocol provided by the application itself.  This document describes a common multicast API that is suitable for transparent communication in underlay and overlay and that grants access to the different flavors of multicast.  It proposes an abstract naming scheme that uses multicast URIs, and it discusses mapping mechanisms between different namespaces and distribution technologies.  Additionally, this document describes the application of this API for building gateways that interconnect current Multicast Domains throughout the Internet.  It reports on an implementation of the programming Interface, including service middleware.

Basic Socket Interface Extensions for
IPv6
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3493.html", target="_top", tooltip="The de facto standard Application Program Interface (API) for TCP/IP applications is the sockets interface.  Although this API was developed for Unix in the early 1980s it has also been implemented on a wide variety of non-Unix systems.  TCP/IP applications written using the sockets API have in the past enjoyed a high degree of portability and we would like the same portability with IPv6 applications.  But changes are required to the sockets API to support IPv6 and this memo describes these changes.  These include a new socket address structure to carry IPv6 addresses, new address conversion functions, and some new socket options.  These extensions are designed to provide access to the basic IPv6 features required by TCP and UDP applications, including multicasting, while introducing a minimum of change into the system and providing complete compatibility for existing IPv4 applications.  Additional extensions for advanced IPv6 features (raw sockets and access to the IPv6 extension headers) are defined in another document.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6219.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents the China Education and Research Network (CERNET)'s IVI translation design and deployment for the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence and transition. The IVI is a prefix-specific and stateless address mapping mechanism for an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet and the IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network scenarios. In the IVI design, subsets of the ISP's IPv4 addresses are embedded in the ISP's IPv6 addresses, and the hosts using these IPv6 addresses can therefore communicate with the global IPv6 Internet directly and can communicate with the global IPv4 Internet via stateless translators. The communications can either be IPv6 initiated or IPv4 initiated. The IVI mechanism supports the end-to-end address transparency and incremental deployment. The IVI is an early design deployed in the CERNET as a reference for the IETF standard documents on IPv4/IPv6 stateless translation.
