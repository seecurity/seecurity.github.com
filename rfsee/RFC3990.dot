Handover Key Management and Re-
Authentication Problem Statement
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5169.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the Handover Keying (HOKEY) re-authentication problem statement.  The current Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) keying framework is not designed to support re-authentication and handovers without re-executing an EAP method.  This often causes unacceptable latency in various mobile wireless environments.  This document details the problem and defines design goals for a generic mechanism to reuse derived EAP keying material for handover.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

It has also translated into an increasing scale of the WLANs. Large-scale deployments made of large numbers of wireless termination points (WTPs) and covering substantial areas are increasingly common. The Wireless LAN Control Protocol (WiCoP) described in this document allows for the control and provisioning of large-scale WLANs. It enables central management of these networks and realizes the objectives set forth for the Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP).
