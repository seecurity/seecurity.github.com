A Media-Based Traceroute Function for
the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2014", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute for SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field to determine the reachability path of requests to a target.  A mechanism for media-loopback calls has also been defined separately, which enables test calls to be generated that result in media being looped back to the originator.  This document describes a means of performing hop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media-loopback mechanism to test the media path when SIP sessions go through media-relaying back-to-back user agents (B2BUAs).", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

An Extension to the Session Description
Protocol (SDP) and Real-time Transport
Protocol (RTP) for Media Loopback
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6849.html", target="_top", tooltip="The wide deployment of Voice over IP (VoIP), real-time text, and Video over IP services has introduced new challenges in managing and maintaining real-time voice/text/video quality, reliability, and overall performance.  In particular, media delivery is an area that needs attention.  One method of meeting these challenges is monitoring the media delivery performance by looping media back to the transmitter.  This is typically referred to as active monitoring of services.  Media loopback is especially popular in ensuring the quality of transport to the edge of a given VoIP, real-time text, or Video over IP service.  Today, in networks that deliver real-time media, short of running 'ping' and 'traceroute' to the edge, administrators are left without the necessary tools to actively monitor, manage, and diagnose quality issues with their service.  The extension defined herein adds new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media types and attributes that enable establishment of media sessions where the media is looped back to the transmitter.  Such media sessions will serve as monitoring and troubleshooting tools by providing the means for measurement of more advanced VoIP, real-time text, and Video over IP performance metrics."];

The Reason Header Field for the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3326.html", target="_top", tooltip="The REGISTER function is used in a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) system primarily to associate a temporary contact address with an address-of-record.  This contact is generally in the form of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), such as Contact: <sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com> and is generally dynamic and associated with the IP address or hostname of the SIP User Agent (UA).  The problem is that network topology may have one or more SIP proxies between the UA and the registrar, such that any request traveling from the user's home network to the registered UA must traverse these proxies.  The REGISTER method does not give us a mechanism to discover and record this sequence of proxies in the registrar for future use.  This document defines an extension header field, Path which provides such a mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
