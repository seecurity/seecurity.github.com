TCP-AO is compatible with either a static Master Key Tuple (MKT) configuration or an external, out-of-band MKT management mechanism; in either case, TCP-AO also protects connections when using the same MKT across repeated instances of a connection, using traffic keys derived from the MKT, and coordinates MKT changes between endpoints.  The result is intended to support current infrastructure uses of TCP MD5, such as to protect long-lived connections (as used, e.g., in BGP and LDP), and to support a larger set of MACs with minimal other system and operational changes.

This method uses the UDP Options packetization layer.  It allows an application to discover the largest size of datagram that can be sent across a network path.  It also provides a way to allow the application to periodically verify the current Maximum Packet Size (MPS) supported by a path and to update this when required."];
