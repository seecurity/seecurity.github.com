Network Service Header (NSH) Fixed-
Length Context Header Allocation
2022", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Network Service Header (NSH) specification defines two possible methods of including metadata (MD): MD Type 0x1 and MD Type 0x2. MD Type 0x1 uses a fixed-length Context Header. The allocation of this Context Header, i.e., its structure and semantics, has not been standardized. This memo defines the Timestamp Context Header, which is an NSH fixed-length Context Header that incorporates the packet's timestamp, a sequence number, and a source interface identifier. Although the definition of the Context Header presented in this document has not been standardized by the IETF, it has been implemented in silicon by several manufacturers and is published here to facilitate interoperability.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Guidelines for Defining Packet

This document specifies guidelines for defining packet timestamp formats in networking protocols at various layers.  It also presents three recommended timestamp formats.  The target audience of this document includes network protocol designers.  It is expected that a new network protocol that requires a packet timestamp will, in most cases, use one of the recommended timestamp formats.  If none of the recommended formats fits the protocol requirements, the new protocol specification should specify the format of the packet timestamp according to the guidelines in this document."];

NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family.  NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs.  It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not required.  It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism."];
