Data packets are tunneled through the backbone, so that the core routers do not need to know the VPN routes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the Framework over time.  The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.

The base model presented here can be extended to include technology-specific details. There are two key benefits of this approach: First, it leads to uniformity between OAM protocols. Second, it supports both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at the same level or different levels through a unified interface) as well as interactive OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at the same level through a unified interface)."];
