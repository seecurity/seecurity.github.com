For the realization of a more comprehensive solution with queuing, this document introduces an architecture for implementing these features in the Session Initiation Protocol where completion of calls implementations associated with the caller's and callee's endpoints cooperate to place the caller's request for completion of calls into a queue at the callee's endpoint; when a caller's request is ready to be serviced, re-attempt of the original, failed call is then made.

Music on hold means that when one party to a call has the call on hold, that party's telephone provides an audio stream (often music) to be heard by the other party.  Architectural features of SIP make it difficult to implement music on hold in a way that is fully standards-compliant.  The implementation of music on hold described in this document is fully effective, is standards-compliant, and has a number of advantages over the methods previously documented.
