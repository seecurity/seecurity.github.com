This document updates RFC 7935 (The Profile for Algorithms and Key Sizes for Use in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure) and obsoletes RFC 8208 (BGPsec Algorithms, Key Formats, and Signature Formats) by adding Documentation and Experimentation Algorithm IDs, correcting the range of unassigned algorithms IDs to fill the complete range, and restructuring the document for better reading. This document also includes example BGPsec UPDATE messages as well as the private keys used to generate the messages and the certificates necessary to validate those signatures."];

Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE

EDHOC provides mutual authentication, forward secrecy, and identity protection.  EDHOC is intended for usage in constrained scenarios, and a main use case is to establish an Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) security context.  By reusing CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) for cryptography, Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) for encoding, and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for transport, the additional code size can be kept very low."];
