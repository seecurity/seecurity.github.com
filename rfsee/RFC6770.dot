Content Distribution Network
Interconnection (CDNI) Problem Statement
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6707.html", target="_top", tooltip="Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide numerous benefits for cacheable content: reduced delivery cost, improved quality of experience for End Users, and increased robustness of delivery. For these reasons, they are frequently used for large-scale content delivery. As a result, existing CDN Providers are scaling up their infrastructure, and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying their own CDNs. It is generally desirable that a given content item can be delivered to an End User regardless of that End User's location or attachment network. This is the motivation for interconnecting standalone CDNs so they can interoperate as an open content delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery of content from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to End Users. However, no standards or open specifications currently exist to facilitate such CDN Interconnection. The goal of this document is to outline the problem area of CDN Interconnection for the IETF CDNI (CDN Interconnection) working group. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Many Network Service Providers (NSPs) and Enterprise Service Providers (ESPs) are also deploying their own CDNs. To deliver contents from the Content Service Provider (CSP) to end users, the contents may traverse across multiple CDNs.
