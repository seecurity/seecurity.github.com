Routing Extensions for Discovery of
Multiprotocol (MPLS) Label Switch Router

Membership
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4972.html", target="_top", tooltip="The setup of a full mesh of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSP) among a set of Label Switch Routers (LSR) is a common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic Engineering either for bandwidth optimization, bandwidth guarantees or fast rerouting with MPLS Fast Reroute.  Such deployment may require the configuration of a potentially large number of TE LSPs (on the order of the square of the number of LSRs).  This document specifies Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) so as to provide an automatic discovery of the set of LSRs members of a mesh in order to automate the creation of such mesh of TE LSPs.

IGP Routing Protocol Extensions for

This requires advertising these capabilities within the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).

IS-IS Protocol Extensions for Path

When the PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating passively in the IGP, a simple and efficient way to announce PCEs consists of using IGP flooding.  For that purpose, this document defines extensions to the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol for the advertisement of PCE Discovery information within an IS-IS area or within the entire IS-IS routing domain.
