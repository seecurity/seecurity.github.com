Internet Code Point (ICP) Assignments
for NSAP Addresses
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document is intended to accomplish two highly inter-related tasks: to establish an initial Internet Code Point (ICP) assignment for each of IPv4 and IPv6 address encoding in Network Service Access Point (NSAP) Addresses, and to recommend an IANA assignment policy for currently unassigned ICP values.  In the first task, this document is a partial replacement for RFC 1888 -- particularly for section 6 of RFC 1888.  In the second task, this document incorporates wording and specifications from ITU-T Recommendation X.213 and further recommends that IANA use the IETF consensus assignment policy in making future ICP assignments.

Routing and Addressing in Networks with

Scenarios
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6139.html", target="_top", tooltip="Routing and Addressing in Networks with Global Enterprise Recursion (RANGER) (RFC 5720) provides an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing.  It provides an incrementally deployable approach for scalability, provider independence, mobility, multihoming, traffic engineering, and security.  This document describes a series of use cases in order to showcase the architectural capabilities.  It further shows how the RANGER architecture restores the network-within-network principles originally intended for the sustained growth of the Internet.

The Internet Routing Overlay Network
(IRON)

This document proposes an Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) that supports sustainable growth while requiring no changes to end systems and no changes to the existing routing system.  IRON further addresses other important issues including routing scaling, mobility management, multihoming, traffic engineering and NAT traversal.  While business considerations are an important determining factor for widespread adoption, they are out of scope for this document.  This document is a product of the IRTF Routing Research Group.
