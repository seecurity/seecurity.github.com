Survey of IPv4 Addresses in Currently
Deployed IETF Security Area Standards
Track and Experimental Documents
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in currently deployed IETF Security Area documented standards.  In order to successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all IPv6 Internet, many interim steps will be taken.  One of these steps is the evolution of current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.  It is hoped that these protocols (and their implementations) will be redesigned to be network address independent, but failing that will at least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To this end, all Standards (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will be surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
