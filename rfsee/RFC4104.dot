These changes and extensions consist of new LDAP object classes and attribute types.  Some of the schema items defined in this document re-implement existing concepts in accordance with their new semantics introduced by RFC 3460.  The other schema items implement new concepts, not covered by RFC 3703.  This document updates RFC 3703. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) Schema
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3703.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a mapping of the Policy Core Information Model to a form that can be implemented in a directory that uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) as its access protocol.  This model defines two hierarchies of object classes: structural classes representing information for representing and controlling policy data as specified in RFC 3060, and relationship classes that indicate how instances of the structural classes are related to each other.  Classes are also added to the LDAP schema to improve the performance of a client's interactions with an LDAP server when the client is retrieving large amounts of policy-related information.  These classes exist only to optimize LDAP retrievals: there are no classes in the information model that correspond to them. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
