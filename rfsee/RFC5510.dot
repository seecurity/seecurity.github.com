Reed-Solomon Forward Error Correction
(FEC) Schemes

This document also describes a Fully-Specified FEC Scheme for the special case of Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8) when there is no encoding symbol group. Finally, in the context of the Under-Specified Small Block Systematic FEC Scheme (FEC Encoding ID 129), this document assigns an FEC Instance ID to the special case of Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8). Reed-Solomon codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes, i.e., they enable a receiver to recover the k source symbols from any set of k received symbols. The schemes described here are compatible with the implementation from Luigi Rizzo. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Both information communicated with the encoded data itself and information that needs to be communicated 'out-of-band' are considered.  The procedures for specifying new FEC codes, defining the information communication requirements associated with those codes and registering them with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) are also described.  The requirements on Content Delivery Protocols that wish to use FEC codes defined within this framework are also defined.

Different classes of FEC codes and some of their basic properties are described and terminology relevant to implementing FEC in a reliable multicast protocol is introduced.  Examples are provided of possible abstract formats for packets carrying FEC.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

The decoder is able to recover the source block from any set of encoding symbols only slightly more in number than the number of source symbols. The Raptor code described here is a systematic code, meaning that all the source symbols are among the encoding symbols that can be generated. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant
Authentication (TESLA): Multicast Source
Authentication Transform Introduction
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4082.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document introduces Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication (TESLA). TESLA allows all receivers to check the integrity and authenticate the source of each packet in multicast or broadcast data streams. TESLA requires no trust between receivers, uses low-cost operations per packet at both sender and receiver, can tolerate any level of loss without retransmissions, and requires no per-receiver state at the sender. TESLA can protect receivers against denial of service attacks in certain circumstances. Each receiver must be loosely time-synchronized with the source in order to verify messages, but otherwise receivers do not have to send any messages. TESLA alone cannot support non-repudiation of the data source to third parties. This informational document is intended to assist in writing standardizable and secure specifications for protocols based on TESLA in different contexts.

These codes have many interesting properties: they are systematic codes, they perform close to ideal codes in many use-cases, and they also feature very high encoding and decoding throughputs.  LDPC-Staircase codes are therefore a good solution to protect a single high bitrate source flow or to protect globally several mid-rate flows within a single FECFRAME instance.
