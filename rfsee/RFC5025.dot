Presence Authorization Rules
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Authorization is a key function in presence systems.  Authorization policies, also known as authorization rules, specify what presence information can be given to which watchers, and when.  This specification defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document format for expressing presence authorization rules.  Such a document can be manipulated by clients using the XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP), although other techniques are permitted.

Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)
Extension for Partial Presence
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5262.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Presence Information Document Format (PIDF) specifies the baseline XML-based format for describing presence information.  One of the characteristics of the PIDF is that the document always needs to carry all presence information available for the presentity.  In some environments where low bandwidth and high latency links can exist, it is often beneficial to limit the amount of transported information over the network.  This document introduces a new MIME type that enables transporting of either only the changed parts or the full PIDF-based presence information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Geolocation Policy: A Document Format
for Expressing Privacy Preferences for
Location Information
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6772.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines an authorization policy language for controlling access to location information. It extends the Common Policy authorization framework to provide location-specific access control. More specifically, this document defines condition elements specific to location information in order to restrict access to data based on the current location of the Target. Furthermore, this document defines two algorithms for reducing the granularity of returned location information. The first algorithm is defined for usage with civic location information, whereas the other one applies to geodetic location information. Both algorithms come with limitations. There are circumstances where the amount of location obfuscation provided is less than what is desired. These algorithms might not be appropriate for all application domains. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
