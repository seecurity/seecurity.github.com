A DNS Resource Record (RR) for Encoding
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP) Information (DHCID RR)
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="It is possible for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) clients to attempt to update the same DNS Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or to update a DNS FQDN that has been added to the DNS for another purpose as they obtain DHCP leases.  Whether the DHCP server or the clients themselves perform the DNS updates, conflicts can arise.  To resolve such conflicts, RFC 4703 proposes storing client identifiers in the DNS to unambiguously associate domain names with the DHCP clients to which they refer.  This memo defines a distinct Resource Record (RR) type for this purpose for use by DHCP clients and servers: the DHCID RR.

Customer Management DNS Resource Records

Because customer management is a shared global responsibility, the Domain Name System (DNS) provides an ideal existing infrastructure for maintaining authoritative customer information that must be readily, reliably, and publicly accessible. This document describes four new DNS resource record types for encoding customer information in the DNS. These records are intended to better facilitate high customer QoE via inter-provider cooperation and management of customer data."];
