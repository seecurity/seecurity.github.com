Name-Based Service Function Forwarder
(nSFF) Component within a Service
Function Chaining (SFC) Framework
2019", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Adoption of cloud and fog technology allows operators to deploy a single Service Function (SF) to multiple execution locations. The decision to steer traffic to a specific location may change frequently based on load, proximity, etc. Under the current Service Function Chaining (SFC) framework, steering traffic dynamically to the different execution endpoints requires a specific rechaining, i.e., a change in the service function path reflecting the different IP endpoints to be used for the new execution points. This procedure may be complex and take time. In order to simplify rechaining and reduce the time to complete the procedure, we discuss separating the logical Service Function Path (SFP) from the specific execution endpoints. This can be done by identifying the SFs using a name rather than a routable IP endpoint (or Layer 2 address). This document describes the necessary extensions, additional functions, and protocol details in the Service Function Forwarder (SFF) to handle name-based relationships. This document presents InterDigital's approach to name-based SFC. It does not represent IETF consensus and is presented here so that the SFC community may benefit from considering this mechanism and the possibility of its use in the edge data centers.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Multicast Using Bit Index Explicit
Replication (BIER)
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8279.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast data packets.  It provides optimal forwarding of multicast packets through a multicast domain.  However, it does not require a protocol for explicitly building multicast distribution trees, nor does it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow state.  This architecture is known as Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER).  When a multicast data packet enters the domain, the ingress router determines the set of egress routers to which the packet needs to be sent.  The ingress router then encapsulates the packet in a BIER header.  The BIER header contains a bit string in which each bit represents exactly one egress router in the domain; to forward the packet to a given set of egress routers, the bits corresponding to those routers are set in the BIER header.  The procedures for forwarding a packet based on its BIER header are specified in this document.  Elimination of the per-flow state and the explicit tree-building protocols results in a considerable simplification."];

This specification defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.  The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
