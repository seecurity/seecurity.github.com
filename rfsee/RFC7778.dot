Mobile Communication Congestion Exposure
Scenario
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This memo describes a mobile communications use case for congestion exposure (ConEx) with a particular focus on those mobile communication networks that are architecturally similar to the 3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS).  This memo provides a brief overview of the architecture of these networks (both access and core networks) and current QoS mechanisms and then discusses how congestion exposure concepts could be applied.  Based on this discussion, this memo suggests a set of requirements for ConEx mechanisms that particularly apply to these mobile networks.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Congestion Exposure (ConEx) Concepts and
Use Cases
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6789.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides the entry point to the set of documentation about the Congestion Exposure (ConEx) protocol.  It explains the motivation for including a ConEx marking at the IP layer: to expose information about congestion to network nodes.  Although such information may have a number of uses, this document focuses on how the information communicated by the ConEx marking can serve as the basis for significantly more efficient and effective traffic management than what exists on the Internet today.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Low Extra Delay Background Transport
(LEDBAT)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6817.html", target="_top", tooltip="Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) is an experimental delay-based congestion control algorithm that seeks to utilize the available bandwidth on an end-to-end path while limiting the consequent increase in queueing delay on that path.  LEDBAT uses changes in one-way delay measurements to limit congestion that the flow itself induces in the network.  LEDBAT is designed for use by background bulk-transfer applications to be no more aggressive than standard TCP congestion control (as specified in RFC 5681) and to yield in the presence of competing flows, thus limiting interference with the network performance of competing flows.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Congestion Exposure (ConEx) Concepts,
Abstract Mechanism, and Requirements
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7713.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders inform the network about the congestion recently encountered by packets in the same flow.  Today, network elements at any layer may signal congestion to the receiver by dropping packets or by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) markings, and the receiver passes this information back to the sender in transport-layer feedback.  The mechanism described here enables the sender to also relay this congestion information back into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total amount of congestion from all elements on the path is revealed to all IP elements along the path, where it could, for example, be used to provide input to traffic management.  This mechanism is called Congestion Exposure, or ConEx.  The companion document, Congestion Exposure (ConEx) Concepts and Use Cases (RFC 6789), provides the entry point to the set of ConEx documentation."];

Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion
Notification
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6040.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document redefines how the explicit congestion notification (ECN) field of the IP header should be constructed on entry to and exit from any IP-in-IP tunnel.  On encapsulation, it updates RFC 3168 to bring all IP-in-IP tunnels (v4 or v6) into line with RFC 4301 IPsec ECN processing.  On decapsulation, it updates both RFC 3168 and RFC 4301 to add new behaviours for previously unused combinations of inner and outer headers.  The new rules ensure the ECN field is correctly propagated across a tunnel whether it is used to signal one or two severity levels of congestion; whereas before, only one severity level was supported.  Tunnel endpoints can be updated in any order without affecting pre-existing uses of the ECN field, thus ensuring backward compatibility.  Nonetheless, operators wanting to support two severity levels (e.g., for pre-congestion notification -- PCN) can require compliance with this new specification.  A thorough analysis of the reasoning for these changes and the implications is included.  In the unlikely event that the new rules do not meet a specific need, RFC 4774 gives guidance on designing alternate ECN semantics, and this document extends that to include tunnelling issues.
