Use of Multipath with MPLS and MPLS
Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7190.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques, and many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in very high-bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core networks. MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) has strongly discouraged the use of multipath techniques. Some degradation of MPLS-TP Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) performance cannot be avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations. Using MPLS Entropy Labels (RFC 6790), MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be carried over multipath links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP-compliant server layer for MPLS-TP LSPs. This document describes the means of supporting MPLS as a server layer for MPLS-TP. The use of MPLS-TP LSPs as a server layer for MPLS LSPs is also discussed."];

Framework and Requirements for GMPLS-

Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)
Networks
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7698.html", target="_top", tooltip="To allow efficient allocation of optical spectral bandwidth for systems that have high bit-rates, the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has extended its Recommendations G.694.1 and G.872 to include a new Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) grid by defining a set of nominal central frequencies, channel spacings, and the concept of the frequency slot. In such an environment, a data-plane connection is switched based on allocated, variable-sized frequency ranges within the optical spectrum, creating what is known as a flexible grid (flexi-grid). Given the specific characteristics of flexi-grid optical networks and their associated technology, this document defines a framework and the associated control-plane requirements for the application of the existing GMPLS architecture and control-plane protocols to the control of flexi-grid DWDM networks. The actual extensions to the GMPLS protocols will be defined in companion documents."];

Problem Statement and Architecture for
Information Exchange between
Interconnected Traffic-Engineered
Networks
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7926.html", target="_top", tooltip="In Traffic-Engineered (TE) systems, it is sometimes desirable to establish an end-to-end TE path with a set of constraints (such as bandwidth) across one or more networks from a source to a destination. TE information is the data relating to nodes and TE links that is used in the process of selecting a TE path. TE information is usually only available within a network. We call such a zone of visibility of TE information a domain. An example of a domain may be an IGP area or an Autonomous System. In order to determine the potential to establish a TE path through a series of connected networks, it is necessary to have available a certain amount of TE information about each network. This need not be the full set of TE information available within each network but does need to express the potential of providing TE connectivity. This subset of TE information is called TE reachability information. This document sets out the problem statement for the exchange of TE information between interconnected TE networks in support of end-to-end TE path establishment and describes the best current practice architecture to meet this problem statement. For reasons that are explained in this document, this work is limited to simple TE constraints and information that determine TE reachability."];

Segment Routing Architecture
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8402.html", target="_top", tooltip="Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called segments. A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service based. A segment can have a semantic local to an SR node or global within an SR domain. SR provides a mechanism that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological path, while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SR domain. SR can be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change to the forwarding plane. A segment is encoded as an MPLS label. An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels. The segment to process is on the top of the stack. Upon completion of a segment, the related label is popped from the stack. SR can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header. A segment is encoded as an IPv6 address. An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing header. The active segment is indicated by the Destination Address (DA) of the packet. The next active segment is indicated by a pointer in the new routing header."];

Use Cases for a PCE as a Central
Controller (PCECC)
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9689.html", target="_top", tooltip="The PCE is a core component of a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) system. It can be used to compute optimal paths for network traffic and update existing paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic demands. The PCE was developed to derive Traffic Engineering (TE) paths in MPLS networks, which are supplied to the headend of the paths using the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP). SDN has much broader applicability than signalled MPLS TE networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range of use cases including static Label-Switched Paths (LSPs), Segment Routing (SR), Service Function Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller. A PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN without necessarily completely replacing it. This document describes general considerations for PCECC deployment and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges and limitations, through a number of use cases. PCEP extensions, which are required for the PCECC use cases, are covered in separate documents."];

An example of such a centralized architecture is the Abstraction and Control of Traffic-Engineered Networks (ACTN) controller hierarchy, as described in RFC 8453.
