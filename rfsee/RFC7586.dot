SARP is targeted for massive data centers with a significant number of Virtual Machines (VMs) that can move across various physical locations.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Problem Statement: Overlays for Network
Virtualization
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7364.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes issues associated with providing multi-tenancy in large data center networks and how these issues may be addressed using an overlay-based network virtualization approach.  A key multi-tenancy requirement is traffic isolation so that one tenant's traffic is not visible to any other tenant.  Another requirement is address space isolation so that different tenants can use the same address space within different virtual networks.  Traffic and address space isolation is achieved by assigning one or more virtual networks to each tenant, where traffic within a virtual network can only cross into another virtual network in a controlled fashion (e.g., via a configured router and/or a security gateway).  Additional functionality is required to provision virtual networks, associating a virtual machine's network interface(s) with the appropriate virtual network and maintaining that association as the virtual machine is activated, migrated, and/or deactivated.  Use of an overlay-based approach enables scalable deployment on large network infrastructures."];

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
Mediation for IP Interworking of Layer 2
VPNs
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6575.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS), detailed in RFC 4664, provides point-to-point connections between pairs of Customer Edge (CE) devices.  It does so by binding two Attachment Circuits (each connecting a CE device with a Provider Edge (PE) device) to a pseudowire (connecting the two PEs).  In general, the Attachment Circuits must be of the same technology (e.g., both Ethernet or both ATM), and the pseudowire must carry the frames of that technology.  However, if it is known that the frames' payload consists solely of IP datagrams, it is possible to provide a point-to-point connection in which the pseudowire connects Attachment Circuits of different technologies.  This requires the PEs to perform a function known as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Mediation.  ARP Mediation refers to the process of resolving Layer 2 addresses when different resolution protocols are used on either Attachment Circuit.  The methods described in this document are applicable even when the CEs run a routing protocol between them, as long as the routing protocol runs over IP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Neighbor Discovery Considerations in
IPv6 Deployments
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9898.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol is a critical component of the
IPv6 architecture. The protocol uses multicast in many messages. It
also assumes a security model where all nodes on a link are trusted.
Such a design might be inefficient in some scenarios (e.g., use of
multicast in wireless networks) or when nodes are not trustworthy
(e.g., public access networks). These security and operational issues
and the associated mitigation solutions are documented in more than
twenty RFCs. There is a need to track these issues and solutions in a
single document. To that aim, this document summarizes the published ND issues and
then describes how all these issues originate from three causes.
Addressing the issues is made simpler by addressing the causes. This
document also analyzes the mitigation solutions and demonstrates that
isolating hosts into different subnets and links can help to address
the three causes. Guidance is provided for selecting a suitable
isolation method to prevent potential ND issues."];
