Despite previous attempts to provide a secure assurance of the origin of SIP communications, we still lack effective standards for identifying the calling party in a VoIP session.

Messaging Use Cases and Extensions for
Secure Telephone Identity Revisited
(STIR)
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9475.html", target="_top", tooltip="Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) provides a means of attesting the identity of a telephone caller via a signed token in order to prevent impersonation of a calling party number, which is a key enabler for illegal robocalling.  Similar impersonation is sometimes leveraged by bad actors in the text and multimedia messaging space.  This document explores the applicability of STIR's Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) and certificate issuance framework to text and multimedia messaging use cases, including support for both messages carried as a payload in SIP requests and messages sent in sessions negotiated by SIP."];

Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT)
Extension for Rich Call Data
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9795.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document extends Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT), a token for conveying cryptographically signed call information about personal communications, to include rich metadata about a call and caller that can be signed and integrity protected, transmitted, and subsequently rendered to the called party.  This framework is intended to include and extend caller- and call-specific information beyond human-readable display name, comparable to the Caller ID function common on the telephone network.  It is also enhanced with an integrity mechanism that is designed to protect the authoring and transport of this information for different authoritative use cases."];

SIP Call-Info Parameters for Rich Call
Data
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9796.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a usage of the SIP Call-Info header field that incorporates Rich Call Data (RCD) associated with the identity of the originating party in order to provide to the terminating party a description of the caller (including details about the reason for the session). RCD includes information about the caller beyond the telephone number (such as a calling name, logo, photo, or jCard object representing the caller), which can help the called party decide how to handle the session request. This document defines three new parameters 'call-reason', 'verified', and 'integrity' for the SIP Call-Info header field and also a new token (jcard) for the 'purpose' parameter of the Call-Info header field. It also provides guidance on the use of the Call-Info 'purpose' parameter token, icon."];
