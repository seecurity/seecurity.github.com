TCP Performance Implications of Network
Path Asymmetry
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3449.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes TCP performance problems that arise because of asymmetric effects.  These problems arise in several access networks, including bandwidth-asymmetric networks and packet radio subnetworks, for different underlying reasons.  However, the end result on TCP performance is the same in both cases: performance often degrades significantly because of imperfection and variability in the ACK feedback from the receiver to the sender.  The document details several mitigations to these effects, which have either been proposed or evaluated in the literature, or are currently deployed in networks.  These solutions use a combination of local link- layer techniques, subnetwork, and end-to-end mechanisms, consisting of: (i) techniques to manage the channel used for the upstream bottleneck link carrying the ACKs, typically using header compression or reducing the frequency of TCP ACKs, (ii) techniques to handle this reduced ACK frequency to retain the TCP sender's acknowledgment-triggered self- clocking and (iii) techniques to schedule the data and ACK packets in the reverse direction to improve performance in the presence of two-way traffic.  Each technique is described, together with known issues, and recommendations for use.  A summary of the recommendations is provided at the end of the document.

Comments on the Usefulness of Simple
Best-Effort Traffic

One observation is that simple best-effort traffic serves a useful role in the Internet, and is worth keeping.  While differential treatment of traffic can clearly be useful, we believe such mechanisms are useful as *adjuncts* to simple best- effort traffic, not as *replacements* of simple best-effort traffic.  A second observation is that for simple best-effort traffic, some form of rough flow-rate fairness is a useful goal for resource allocation, where flow-rate fairness is defined by the goal of equal flow rates for different flows over the same path.

QSPEC Template for the Quality-of-

Rather, all information specific to a QOSM is encapsulated in a separate object, the QSPEC.  This document defines a template for the QSPEC including a number of QSPEC parameters.  The QSPEC parameters provide a common language to be reused in several QOSMs and thereby aim to ensure the extensibility and interoperability of QoS NSLP.  While the base protocol is QOSM-agnostic, the parameters that can be carried in the QSPEC object are possibly closely coupled to specific models.  The node initiating the NSIS signaling adds an Initiator QSPEC, which indicates the QSPEC parameters that must be interpreted by the downstream nodes less the reservation fails, thereby ensuring the intention of the NSIS initiator is preserved along the signaling path.
