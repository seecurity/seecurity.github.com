Analysis on IPv6 Transition in Third

Networks
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4215.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document analyzes the transition to IPv6 in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) packet networks. These networks are based on General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology, and the radio network architecture is based on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)/Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technology. The focus is on analyzing different transition scenarios and applicable transition mechanisms and finding solutions for those transition scenarios. In these scenarios, the User Equipment (UE) connects to other nodes, e.g., in the Internet, and IPv6/IPv4 transition mechanisms are needed. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

The configuration payloads specified in RFC 4306 work well for IPv4 but make it difficult to use certain features of IPv6.  This document specifies new configuration attributes for IKEv2 that allows the VPN gateway to assign IPv6 prefixes to clients, enabling all features of IPv6 to be used with the client-gateway virtual link.

With its increase in the number of available prefixes and addresses in a subnet, and improvements in address management, IPv6 is the only real option on the table.  Yet, IPv6 deployment requires some effort, resources, and expertise.  The availability of many different deployment models is one reason why expertise is required.  This document discusses the IPv6 deployment models and migration tools, and it recommends ones that have been found to work well in operational networks in many common situations.

DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in Long-Term

Based on the idea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes, we use DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation to address such prefix management issues as an access router offloading delegation of prefixes and release tasks to a DHCPv6 server.  The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node from the DHCPv6 server.  The access router may next do stateless or stateful address allocation to the mobile node, e.g., with a Router Advertisement or using DHCP.  We also describe prefix management using Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers.
