Such interactions include path computation requests and path computation replies as well as notifications of specific states related to the use of a PCE in the context of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering.  PCEP is designed to be flexible and extensible so as to easily allow for the addition of further messages and objects, should further requirements be expressed in the future. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Its objective is to provide guidance for the definition, selection and specification of a technical solution addressing these requirements.  Specification for this solution itself is outside the scope of this document.  A problem statement is first provided.  Then, the document describes example applications scenarios identified by Service Providers where existing MPLS Traffic Engineering mechanisms fall short and Diff-Serv-aware Traffic Engineering can address the needs.  The detailed requirements that need to be addressed by the technical solution are also reviewed.  Finally, the document identifies the evaluation criteria that should be considered for selection and definition of the technical solution.
