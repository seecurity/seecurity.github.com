This document defines the protocol extensions for L2TP to set up different types of L2VPNs in a unified fashion. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Provisioning, Auto-Discovery, and
Signaling in Layer 2 Virtual Private
Networks (L2VPNs)
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6074.html", target="_top", tooltip="Provider Provisioned Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs) may have different provisioning models, i.e., models for what information needs to be configured in what entities.  Once configured, the provisioning information is distributed by a discovery process.  When the discovery process is complete, a signaling protocol is automatically invoked to set up the mesh of pseudowires (PWs) that form the (virtual) backbone of the L2VPN.  This document specifies a number of L2VPN provisioning models, and further specifies the semantic structure of the endpoint identifiers required by each model.  It discusses the distribution of these identifiers by the discovery process, especially when discovery is based on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  It then specifies how the endpoint identifiers are carried in the two signaling protocols that are used to set up PWs, the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), and the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3 (L2TPv3).

The L2NM is particularly meant to be used by a network controller to derive the configuration information that will be sent to relevant network devices.
