Design Goals for Scalable Internet
Routing

The Routing Research Group is investigating an alternate architecture to meet these challenges.  This document consists of a prioritized list of design goals for the target architecture.

Report from the IAB Workshop on Routing
and Addressing
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4984.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document reports the outcome of the Routing and Addressing Workshop that was held by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on October 18-19, 2006, in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The primary goal of the workshop was to develop a shared understanding of the problems that the large backbone operators are facing regarding the scalability of today's Internet routing system. The key workshop findings include an analysis of the major factors that are driving routing table growth, constraints in router technology, and the limitations of today's Internet addressing architecture. It is hoped that these findings will serve as input to the IETF community and help identify next steps towards effective solutions. Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and not of the IAB. Furthermore, note that work on issues related to this workshop report is continuing, and this document does not intend to reflect the increased understanding of issues nor to discuss the range of potential solutions that may be the outcome of this ongoing work. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Architectural Principles of the Internet

While this process of evolution is one of the main reasons for the technology's success, it nevertheless seems useful to record a snapshot of the current principles of the Internet architecture.  This is intended for general guidance and general interest, and is in no way intended to be a formal or invariant reference model.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.

Procedures for Renumbering an IPv6
Network without a Flag Day
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4192.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a procedure that can be used to renumber a network from one prefix to another.  It uses IPv6's intrinsic ability to assign multiple addresses to a network interface to provide continuity of network service through a make-before-break transition, as well as addresses naming and configuration management issues.  It also uses other IPv6 features to minimize the effort and time required to complete the transition from the old prefix to the new prefix.

Hierarchical IPv4 Framework
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6306.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a framework for how the current IPv4 address space can be divided into two new address categories: a core address space (Area Locators, ALOCs) that is globally unique, and an edge address space (Endpoint Locators, ELOCs) that is regionally unique. In the future, the ELOC space will only be significant in a private network or in a service provider domain. Therefore, a 32x32 bit addressing scheme and a hierarchical routing architecture are achieved. The hierarchical IPv4 framework is backwards compatible with the current IPv4 Internet. This document also discusses a method for decoupling the location and identifier functions -- future applications can make use of the separation. The framework requires extensions to the existing Domain Name System (DNS), the existing IPv4 stack of the endpoints, middleboxes, and routers in the Internet. The framework can be implemented incrementally for endpoints, DNS, middleboxes, and routers. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];
