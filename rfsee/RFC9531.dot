Path Steering in Content-Centric
Networking (CCNx) and Named Data
Networking (NDN)
2024", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Path steering is a mechanism to discover paths to the producers of Information-Centric Networking (ICN) Content Objects and steer subsequent Interest messages along a previously discovered path. It has various uses, including the operation of state-of-the-art multi-path congestion control algorithms and for network measurement and management. This specification derives directly from the design published in Path Switching in Content Centric and Named Data Networks (4th ACM Conference on Information-Centric Networking) and, therefore, does not recapitulate the design motivations, implementation details, or evaluation of the scheme. However, some technical details are different, and where there are differences, the design documented here is to be considered definitive.

Content-Centric Networking (CCNx)
Semantics
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8569.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the core concepts of the Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) architecture and presents a network protocol based on two messages: Interests and Content Objects. It specifies the set of mandatory and optional fields within those messages and describes their behavior and interpretation. This architecture and protocol specification is independent of a specific wire encoding. The protocol also uses a control message called an Interest Return, whereby one system can return an Interest message to the previous hop due to an error condition. This indicates to the previous hop that the current system will not respond to the Interest. This document is a product of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG). The document received wide review among ICNRG participants. Two full implementations are in active use and have informed the technical maturity of the protocol specification."];

Detecting Multiprotocol Label Switched

2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8029.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a simple and efficient mechanism to detect data-plane failures in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). It defines a probe message called an MPLS echo request and a response message called an MPLS echo reply for returning the result of the probe. The MPLS echo request is intended to contain sufficient information to check correct operation of the data plane and to verify the data plane against the control plane, thereby localizing faults. This document obsoletes RFCs 4379, 6424, 6829, and 7537, and updates RFC 1122."];

Current Open Questions in Path-Aware
Networking
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9217.html", target="_top", tooltip="In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware internetworking architecture has two important properties: it exposes the properties of available Internet paths to endpoints, and it provides for endpoints and applications to use these properties to select paths through the Internet for their traffic. While this property of path awareness already exists in many Internet-connected networks within single domains and via administrative interfaces to the network layer, a fully path-aware internetwork expands these concepts across layers and across the Internet. This document poses questions in path-aware networking, open as of 2021, that must be answered in the design, development, and deployment of path-aware internetworks. It was originally written to frame discussions in the Path Aware Networking Research Group (PANRG), and has been published to snapshot current thinking in this space."];
