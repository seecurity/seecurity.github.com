Use Cases for In-Network Computing
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Computing in the Network (COIN) comes with the prospect of deploying processing functionality on networking devices such as switches and network interface cards. While such functionality can be beneficial, it has to be carefully placed into the context of the general Internet communication, and it needs to be clearly identified where and how those benefits apply. This document presents some use cases to demonstrate how a number of salient COIN-related applications can benefit from COIN. Furthermore, to guide research on COIN, it identifies essential research questions and outlines desirable capabilities that COIN systems addressing these use cases may need to support. Finally, the document provides a preliminary categorization of the described research questions to source future work in this domain. This document is a product of the Computing in the Network Research Group (COINRG). It is not an IETF product and it is not a standard.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Inter-Destination Media Synchronization
(IDMS) Using the RTP Control Protocol
(RTCP)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7272.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Packet Type and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block Type to be used for achieving Inter-Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS). IDMS is the process of synchronizing playout across multiple media receivers. Using the RTCP XR IDMS Report Block defined in this document, media playout information from participants in a synchronization group can be collected. Based on the collected information, an RTCP IDMS Settings Packet can then be sent to distribute a common target playout point to which all the distributed receivers, sharing a media experience, can synchronize. Typical use cases in which IDMS is useful are social TV, shared service control (i.e., applications where two or more geographically separated users are watching a media stream together), distance learning, networked video walls, networked loudspeakers, etc."];

Multipath Time Synchronization
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8039.html", target="_top", tooltip="Clock synchronization protocols are very widely used in IP-based networks.  The Network Time Protocol (NTP) has been commonly deployed for many years, and the last few years have seen an increasingly rapid deployment of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP).  As time-sensitive applications evolve, clock accuracy requirements are becoming increasingly stringent, requiring the time synchronization protocols to provide high accuracy.  This memo describes a multipath approach to PTP and NTP over IP networks, allowing the protocols to run concurrently over multiple communication paths between the master and slave clocks, without modifying these protocols.  The multipath approach can significantly contribute to clock accuracy, security, and fault tolerance.  The multipath approach that is presented in this document enables backward compatibility with nodes that do not support the multipath functionality."];
