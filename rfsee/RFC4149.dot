First, the memo motivates periodic sampling and addresses the question of its value as an alternative to the Poisson sampling described in RFC 2330.  The benefits include applicability to active and passive measurements, simulation of constant bit rate (CBR) traffic (typical of multimedia communication, or nearly CBR, as found with voice activity detection), and several instances in which analysis can be simplified.  The sampling method avoids predictability by mandating random start times and finite length tests.  Following descriptions of the sampling method and sample metric parameters, measurement methods and errors are discussed.  Finally, we give additional information on periodic measurements, including security considerations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
