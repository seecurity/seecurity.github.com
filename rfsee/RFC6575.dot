Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
Mediation for IP Interworking of Layer 2
VPNs
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS), detailed in RFC 4664, provides point-to-point connections between pairs of Customer Edge (CE) devices.  It does so by binding two Attachment Circuits (each connecting a CE device with a Provider Edge (PE) device) to a pseudowire (connecting the two PEs).  In general, the Attachment Circuits must be of the same technology (e.g., both Ethernet or both ATM), and the pseudowire must carry the frames of that technology.  However, if it is known that the frames' payload consists solely of IP datagrams, it is possible to provide a point-to-point connection in which the pseudowire connects Attachment Circuits of different technologies.  This requires the PEs to perform a function known as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Mediation.  ARP Mediation refers to the process of resolving Layer 2 addresses when different resolution protocols are used on either Attachment Circuit.  The methods described in this document are applicable even when the CEs run a routing protocol between them, as long as the routing protocol runs over IP.

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.

Such a design might be inefficient in some scenarios (e.g., use of
multicast in wireless networks) or when nodes are not trustworthy
(e.g., public access networks). These security and operational issues
and the associated mitigation solutions are documented in more than
twenty RFCs. There is a need to track these issues and solutions in a
single document. To that aim, this document summarizes the published ND issues and
then describes how all these issues originate from three causes.
Addressing the issues is made simpler by addressing the causes. This
document also analyzes the mitigation solutions and demonstrates that
isolating hosts into different subnets and links can help to address
the three causes. Guidance is provided for selecting a suitable
isolation method to prevent potential ND issues."];
