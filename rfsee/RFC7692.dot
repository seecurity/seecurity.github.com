Compression Extensions for WebSocket
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines a framework for creating WebSocket extensions that add compression functionality to the WebSocket Protocol.  An extension based on this framework compresses the payload data portion of WebSocket data messages on a per-message basis using parameters negotiated during the opening handshake.  This framework provides a general method for applying a compression algorithm to the contents of WebSocket messages.  Each compression algorithm has to be defined in a document defining the extension by specifying the parameter negotiation and the payload transformation algorithm in detail.  This document also specifies one specific compression extension using the DEFLATE algorithm.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

The WebSocket Protocol
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6455.html", target="_top", tooltip="The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code.  The security model used for this is the origin-based security model commonly used by web browsers.  The protocol consists of an opening handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP.  The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications that need two-way communication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g., using XMLHttpRequest or <iframe>s and long polling).
