The purpose of this document is, on the one hand, to help system developers and users to select appropriate standard management protocols and data models to address relevant management needs.  On the other hand, the document can be used as an overview and guideline by other Standard Development Organizations or bodies planning to use IETF management technologies and data models.  This document does not cover Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) technologies on the data-path, e.g., OAM of tunnels, MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) OAM, and pseudowire as well as the corresponding management models.

DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in Long-Term
Evolution (LTE) Networks
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6653.html", target="_top", tooltip="As interest in IPv6 deployment in cellular networks increases, several migration issues have been being raised; IPv6 prefix management is the issue addressed in this document.  Based on the idea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes, we use DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation to address such prefix management issues as an access router offloading delegation of prefixes and release tasks to a DHCPv6 server.  The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node from the DHCPv6 server.  The access router may next do stateless or stateful address allocation to the mobile node, e.g., with a Router Advertisement or using DHCP.  We also describe prefix management using Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers.

This architecture assumes that the Network Access Server (NAS) acts as both a DHCPv6 relay agent and RADIUS client.  When receiving messages from the DHCPv6 clients, the NAS consults the RADIUS server and adds the RADIUS response when forwarding the DHCPv6 client's messages to the DHCPv6 server.  The DHCPv6 server then uses that additional information to generate an appropriate response to the DHCPv6 client's requests."];

This document enumerates the information that needs to be provisioned on a customer edge router to support a list of transition techniques based on tunneling IPv4 in IPv6, with a view to defining reusable components for a reasonable transition path between these techniques.  To the extent that the provisioning is done dynamically, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) support is needed to provide the information to the network server responsible for passing the information to the customer equipment.  This document specifies Diameter (RFC 6733) Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) to be used for that purpose."];
