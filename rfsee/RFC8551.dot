Randomness Requirements for Security

However, the security of these systems is dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar quantities.

A sophisticated attacker may find it easier to reproduce the environment that produced the secret quantities and to search the resulting small set of possibilities than to locate the quantities in the whole of the potential number space. Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult. This document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for generating such quantities. It recommends the use of truly random hardware techniques and shows that the existing hardware on many systems can be used for this purpose.

Determining Strengths For Public Keys

That level of attack resistance is the strength of the system, and the symmetric keys that are exchanged must be at least as strong as the system strength requirements.  The three quantities, system strength, symmetric key strength, and public key strength, must be consistently matched for any network protocol usage.  While it is fairly easy to express the system strength requirements in terms of a symmetric key length and to choose a cipher that has a key length equal to or exceeding that requirement, it is harder to choose a public key that has a cryptographic strength meeting a symmetric key strength requirement.  This document explains how to determine the length of an asymmetric key as a function of a symmetric key strength requirement.  Some rules of thumb for estimating equivalent resistance to large-scale attacks on various algorithms are given.

Message Digest for DNS Zones

This provides assurance that received zone data matches published data, regardless of how the zone data has been transmitted and received. When used without DNSSEC, ZONEMD functions as a checksum, guarding only against unintentional changes. ZONEMD does not replace DNSSEC: DNSSEC protects individual RRsets (DNS data with fine granularity), whereas ZONEMD protects a zone's data as a whole, whether consumed by authoritative name servers, recursive name servers, or any other applications. As specified herein, ZONEMD is impractical for large, dynamic zones due to the time and resources required for digest calculation.
