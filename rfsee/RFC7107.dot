Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.

2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7030.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document profiles certificate enrollment for clients using Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) messages over a secure transport.  This profile, called Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST), describes a simple, yet functional, certificate management protocol targeting Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) clients that need to acquire client certificates and associated Certification Authority (CA) certificates.  It also supports client-generated public/private key pairs as well as key pairs generated by the CA."];

Wrapping a Hashed Message Authentication

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Key

The first method defined uses a Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard) key to encrypt the HMAC key.  The second method defined uses an AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) key to encrypt the HMAC key.  One place that such an algorithm is used is for the Authenticated Data type in CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax). [PROPOSED STANDARD]"];

Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) has not currently defined any hash algorithms with parameters, but anecdotal evidence suggests that defining one could cause major problems.
