This document specifies an experimental variant of Internet mail that permits the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8, rather than ASCII, as the base form for Internet email header field.

Downgrading Mechanism for Email Address
Internationalization

The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension allows UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail header fields.  To avoid rejecting internationalized email messages when a server in the delivery path does not support the UTF8SMTP extension, some sort of converting mechanism is required.  This document describes a downgrading mechanism for Email Address Internationalization.  Note that this is a way to downgrade, not tunnel.  There is no associated up-conversion mechanism, although internationalized email clients might use original internationalized addresses or other data when displaying or replying to downgraded messages.

These changes have been evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve both its installed base and its usefulness.  To collaborate productively on this large and complex system, all participants need to work from a common view of it and use a common language to describe its components and the interactions among them.
