Completion of Calls for the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The completion of calls feature defined in this specification allows the caller of a failed call to be notified when the callee becomes available to receive a call.

For the realization of a more comprehensive solution with queuing, this document introduces an architecture for implementing these features in the Session Initiation Protocol where completion of calls implementations associated with the caller's and callee's endpoints cooperate to place the caller's request for completion of calls into a queue at the callee's endpoint; when a caller's request is ready to be serviced, re-attempt of the original, failed call is then made. The architecture is designed to interoperate well with existing completion of calls solutions in other networks.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

This information would allow a CCMP-enabled client that joins a conference using SIP to also register for the Centralized Conferencing (XCON) conference event package and take advantage of CCMP operations on the conference. This document describes two mechanisms, depending upon the need of the User Agent (UA), to address the above limitation.

URNs for the Alert-Info Header Field of

This is done using the Alert-Info header field. However, the reference (typically a URL) addresses only a specific network resource with specific rendering properties. There is currently no support for standard identifiers for describing the semantics of the alerting situation or the characteristics of the alerting signal, without being tied to a particular rendering. To overcome these limitations and support new applications, a new family of URNs for use in Alert-Info header fields (and situations with similar requirements) is defined in this specification. This document normatively updates RFC 3261, which defines the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). It changes the usage of the Alert-Info header field defined in RFC 3261 by additionally allowing its use in any non-100 provisional response to INVITE.
