In addition, support for strong security (and its negotiation), COMPOUND operations, client caching, and internationalization has been added. Of course, attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an Internet environment.

Minor Version 1 Protocol

Major extensions introduced in NFS version 4 minor version 1 include Sessions, Directory Delegations, and parallel NFS (pNFS).  NFS version 4 minor version 1 has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and it is considered a separate protocol.  Thus, this document neither updates nor obsoletes RFC 3530.
