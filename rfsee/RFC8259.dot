Servers
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9645.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents four YANG 1.1 modules -- three IETF modules and one supporting IANA module. The three IETF modules are ietf-tls-common, ietf-tls-client, and ietf-tls-server. The ietf-tls-client and ietf-tls-server modules are the primary productions of this work, supporting the configuration and monitoring of TLS clients and servers. The IANA module is iana-tls-cipher-suite-algs. This module defines YANG enumerations that provide support for an IANA-maintained algorithm registry."];

YANG Data Model for TCP
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9648.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a minimal YANG data model for TCP on devices that are configured and managed by network management protocols.  The YANG data model defines a container for all TCP connections and groupings of authentication parameters that can be imported and used in TCP implementations or by other models that need to configure TCP parameters.  The model also includes basic TCP statistics.  The model is compliant with Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) (RFC 8342)."];

The Entity Attestation Token (EAT)
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9711.html", target="_top", tooltip="An Entity Attestation Token (EAT) provides an attested claims set that describes the state and characteristics of an entity, a device such as a smartphone, an Internet of Things (IoT) device, network equipment, or such. This claims set is used by a relying party, server, or service to determine the type and degree of trust placed in the entity. An EAT is either a CBOR Web Token (CWT) or a JSON Web Token (JWT) with attestation-oriented claims."];

Notification of Revoked Access Tokens in
the Authentication and Authorization for
Constrained Environments (ACE) Framework
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9770.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a method of the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework, which allows an authorization server to notify clients and resource servers (i.e., registered devices) about revoked access tokens.  As specified in this document, the method allows clients and resource servers (RSs) to access a Token Revocation List (TRL) on the authorization server by using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), with the possible additional use of resource observation.  Resulting (unsolicited) notifications of revoked access tokens complement alternative approaches such as token introspection, while not requiring additional endpoints on clients and RSs."];

Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT)
Extension for Rich Call Data
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9795.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document extends Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT), a token for conveying cryptographically signed call information about personal communications, to include rich metadata about a call and caller that can be signed and integrity protected, transmitted, and subsequently rendered to the called party.  This framework is intended to include and extend caller- and call-specific information beyond human-readable display name, comparable to the Caller ID function common on the telephone network.  It is also enhanced with an integrity mechanism that is designed to protect the authoring and transport of this information for different authoritative use cases."];

SIP Call-Info Parameters for Rich Call
Data

RCD includes information about the caller beyond the telephone number (such as a calling name, logo, photo, or jCard object representing the caller), which can help the called party decide how to handle the session request. This document defines three new parameters 'call-reason', 'verified', and 'integrity' for the SIP Call-Info header field and also a new token (jcard) for the 'purpose' parameter of the Call-Info header field. It also provides guidance on the use of the Call-Info 'purpose' parameter token, icon."];

Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI)
S-Expressions

It has been and is being used elsewhere.  There are multiple implementations in a variety of programming languages.  Uses of this representation are referred to in this document as S-expressions.  This memo makes precise the encodings of these SPKI S-expressions: It gives a canonical form for them, describes two transport representations, and also describes an advanced format for display to people."];
