Transition Scenarios for 3GPP Networks

Analysis on IPv6 Transition in Third
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
Networks
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4215.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document analyzes the transition to IPv6 in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) packet networks. These networks are based on General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology, and the radio network architecture is based on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)/Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technology. The focus is on analyzing different transition scenarios and applicable transition mechanisms and finding solutions for those transition scenarios. In these scenarios, the User Equipment (UE) connects to other nodes, e.g., in the Internet, and IPv6/IPv4 transition mechanisms are needed. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Guidelines for Using IPv6 Transition
Mechanisms during IPv6 Deployment
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6180.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet continues to grow beyond the capabilities of IPv4.  An expansion in the address space is clearly required.  With its increase in the number of available prefixes and addresses in a subnet, and improvements in address management, IPv6 is the only real option on the table.  Yet, IPv6 deployment requires some effort, resources, and expertise.  The availability of many different deployment models is one reason why expertise is required.  This document discusses the IPv6 deployment models and migration tools, and it recommends ones that have been found to work well in operational networks in many common situations.

An Overview of the IETF Network
Management Standards

The document refers to other overview documents, where they exist and classifies the standards for easy orientation.  The purpose of this document is, on the one hand, to help system developers and users to select appropriate standard management protocols and data models to address relevant management needs.  On the other hand, the document can be used as an overview and guideline by other Standard Development Organizations or bodies planning to use IETF management technologies and data models.  This document does not cover Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) technologies on the data-path, e.g., OAM of tunnels, MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) OAM, and pseudowire as well as the corresponding management models.
