Route computation has been controlled by relatively static policies that define link cost, route cost, or import and export routing policies. Requirements have emerged to more dynamically manage and program routing systems due to the advent of highly dynamic data-center networking, on-demand WAN services, dynamic policy-driven traffic steering and service chaining, the need for real-time security threat responsiveness via traffic control, and a paradigm of separating policy-based decision-making from the router itself.

Network virtualization is following a similar path as previously taken by cloud computing.  Specifically, cloud computing popularized migration of computing functions (e.g., applications) and storage from local, dedicated, physical resources to remote virtual functions accessible through the Internet.  In a similar manner, network virtualization is encouraging migration of networking functions from dedicated physical hardware nodes to a virtualized pool of resources.  However, network virtualization can be considered to be a more complex problem than cloud computing as it not only involves virtualization of computing and storage functions but also involves abstraction of the network itself.  This document describes current research and engineering challenges in network virtualization including the guarantee of quality of service, performance improvement, support for multiple domains, network slicing, service composition, device virtualization, privacy and security, separation of control concerns, network function placement, and testing.  In addition, some proposals are made for new activities in the IETF and IRTF that could address some of these challenges.

Interworking of GMPLS Control and
Centralized Controller Systems
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9730.html", target="_top", tooltip="Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows each network element (NE) to perform local resource discovery, routing, and signaling in a distributed manner. The advancement of software-defined transport networking technology enables a group of NEs to be managed through centralized controller hierarchies. This helps to tackle challenges arising from multiple domains, vendors, and technologies. An example of such a centralized architecture is the Abstraction and Control of Traffic-Engineered Networks (ACTN) controller hierarchy, as described in RFC 8453. Both the distributed and centralized control planes have their respective advantages and should complement each other in the system, rather than compete. This document outlines how the GMPLS distributed control plane can work together with a centralized controller system in a transport network."];
