The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
Implementation Survey Results
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), described in RFC 3031, is a method for forwarding packets that uses short, fixed-length values carried by packets, called labels, to determine packet next hops.  A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through them.  This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called a Label Distribution Protocol (as described in RFC 3036) , by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has made.  One such protocol, called LDP, is used by LSRs to distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths.  This document reports on a survey of LDP implementations conducted in August 2002 as part of the process of advancing LDP from Proposed to Draft Standard.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
