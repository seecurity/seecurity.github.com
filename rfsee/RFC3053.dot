IPv6 Tunnel Broker

ISP IPv6 Deployment Scenarios in

Cable/HFC, BB Ethernet, xDSL, and WLAN are the main BB technologies that are currently deployed, and discussed in this document.  The emerging Broadband Power Line Communications (PLC/BPL) access technology is also discussed for completeness.  In this document we will discuss main components of IPv6 BB networks, their differences from IPv4 BB networks, and how IPv6 is deployed and integrated in each of these networks using tunneling mechanisms and native IPv6.

The standards will encourage multiple, inter-operable vendor implementations by identifying, and extending where necessary, existing standard protocols to resolve a selected set of IPv4/IPv6 and IPv6/IPv4 transition problems.  This document describes the specific problems (Hubs and Spokes and Mesh) that will be solved by the standards developed by the Softwires Working Group.

IPv6 Unicast Address Assignment
Considerations

With its new address architecture and allocation policies, the introduction of IPv6 into a network means that network designers and operators need to reconsider their existing approaches to network addressing.  Lack of guidelines on handling this aspect of network design could slow down the deployment and integration of IPv6.  This document aims to provide the information and recommendations relevant to planning the addressing aspects of IPv6 deployments.

IPv6 Tunnel Broker with the Tunnel Setup
Protocol (TSP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5572.html", target="_top", tooltip="A tunnel broker with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) enables the establishment of tunnels of various inner protocols, such as IPv6 or IPv4, inside various outer protocols packets, such as IPv4, IPv6, or UDP over IPv4 for IPv4 NAT traversal.  The control protocol (TSP) is used by the tunnel client to negotiate the tunnel with the broker.  A mobile node implementing TSP can be connected to both IPv4 and IPv6 networks whether it is on IPv4 only, IPv4 behind a NAT, or on IPv6 only.  A tunnel broker may terminate the tunnels on remote tunnel servers or on itself.  This document describes the TSP within the model of the tunnel broker model.

Guidelines for Using IPv6 Transition
Mechanisms during IPv6 Deployment
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6180.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet continues to grow beyond the capabilities of IPv4.  An expansion in the address space is clearly required.  With its increase in the number of available prefixes and addresses in a subnet, and improvements in address management, IPv6 is the only real option on the table.  Yet, IPv6 deployment requires some effort, resources, and expertise.  The availability of many different deployment models is one reason why expertise is required.  This document discusses the IPv6 deployment models and migration tools, and it recommends ones that have been found to work well in operational networks in many common situations.

An Incremental Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN)
for IPv6 Transition
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6264.html", target="_top", tooltip="Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected. As IPv4 address exhaustion approaches, IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues become more critical and less tractable. Host-based transition mechanisms used in dual-stack environments cannot meet all transition requirements. Most end users are not sufficiently expert to configure or maintain host-based transition mechanisms. Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) devices with integrated transition mechanisms can reduce the operational changes required during the IPv4 to IPv6 migration or coexistence period. This document proposes an incremental CGN approach for IPv6 transition. It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6 hosts and IPv4 access services for IPv4 hosts while leaving much of a legacy ISP network unchanged during the initial stage of IPv4 to IPv6 migration. Unlike CGN alone, incremental CGN also supports and encourages smooth transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks. An integrated configurable CGN device and an adaptive home gateway (HG) device are described. Both are reusable during different transition phases, avoiding multiple upgrades. This enables IPv6 migration to be incrementally achieved according to real user requirements.

Native IPv6 behind IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT
Customer Premises Equipment (6a44)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6751.html", target="_top", tooltip="In customer sites having IPv4-only Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), Teredo (RFC 4380, RFC 5991, RFC 6081) provides last-resort IPv6 connectivity.  However, because it is designed to work without the involvement of Internet Service Providers, it has significant limitations (connectivity between IPv6 native addresses and Teredo addresses is uncertain; connectivity between Teredo addresses fails for some combinations of NAT types).  6a44 is a complementary solution that, being based on ISP cooperation, avoids these limitations.  At the beginning of 6a44 IPv6 addresses, it replaces the Teredo well-known prefix, present at the beginning of Teredo IPv6 addresses, with network-specific /48 prefixes assigned by local ISPs (an evolution similar to that from 6to4 to 6rd (IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures)).  The specification is expected to be complete enough for running code to be independently written and the solution to be incrementally deployed and used.

Operational Guidance for IPv6 Deployment

Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol

These sites range in size from small home/office networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that IPv4 provides satisfactory internal routing and addressing services for most applications.  As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed, however, end-user devices within such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6 functionality.
