A Presence Event Package for the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of presence.  Presence is defined as the willingness and ability of a user to communicate with other users on the network.  Historically, presence has been limited to on-line and off-line indicators; the notion of presence here is broader.  Subscriptions and notifications of presence are supported by defining an event package within the general SIP event notification framework.  This protocol is also compliant with the Common Presence Profile (CPP) framework. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8996.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document formally deprecates Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346). Accordingly, those documents have been moved to Historic status. These versions lack support for current and recommended cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms, and various government and industry profiles of applications using TLS now mandate avoiding these old TLS versions. TLS version 1.2 became the recommended version for IETF protocols in 2008 (subsequently being obsoleted by TLS version 1.3 in 2018), providing sufficient time to transition away from older versions. Removing support for older versions from implementations reduces the attack surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines library and product maintenance. This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC 4347) but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1. This document updates many RFCs that normatively refer to TLS version 1.0 or TLS version 1.1, as described herein. This document also updates the best practices for TLS usage in RFC 7525; hence, it is part of BCP 195."];

An Extension to Session Initiation

Event Notification

These procedures provide no tools to avoid replaying event notifications that have already been received by a user agent.  This memo defines an extension to SIP events that allows the subscriber to condition the subscription request to whether the state has changed since the previous notification was received.  When such a condition is true, either the body of a resulting event notification or the entire notification message is suppressed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

To enable discussion of multi-party features and applications, we define an abstract call model for describing the media relationships required by many of these.  The model and actions described here are specifically chosen to be independent of the SIP signaling and/or mixing approach chosen to actually set up the media relationships.  In addition to its dialog manipulation aspect, this framework includes requirements for communicating related information and events such as conference and session state and session history.  This framework also describes other goals that embody the spirit of SIP applications as used on the Internet such as the definition of primitives (not services), invoker and participant oriented primitives, signaling and mixing model independence, and others.
