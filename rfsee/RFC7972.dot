The URN WG has defined a syntax for URNs in RFC 2141, as well as some proposed mechanisms for their resolution and use in Internet applications in RFC 3401 and RFC 3405.  The whole rests on the concept of individual namespaces within the URN structure.  Apart from proof-of-concept namespaces, the use of existing identifiers in URNs has been discussed in RFC 2288.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];

Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
