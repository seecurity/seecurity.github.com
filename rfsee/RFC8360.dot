Resource Public Key Infrastructure
(RPKI) Validation Reconsidered
2018", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies an alternative to the certificate validation procedure specified in RFC 6487 that reduces aspects of operational fragility in the management of certificates in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), while retaining essential security features. The procedure specified in RFC 6487 requires that Resource Certificates are rejected entirely if they are found to overclaim any resources not contained on the issuing certificate, whereas the validation process defined here allows an issuing Certification Authority (CA) to chose to communicate that such Resource Certificates should be accepted for the intersection of their resources and the issuing certificate. It should be noted that the validation process defined here considers validation under a single trust anchor (TA) only. In particular, concerns regarding overclaims where multiple configured TAs claim overlapping resources are considered out of scope for this document. This choice is signaled by a set of alternative Object Identifiers (OIDs) per X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers (RFC 3779) and Certificate Policy (CP) for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) (RFC 6484). It should be noted that in case these OIDs are not used for any certificate under a trust anchor, the validation procedure defined here has the same outcome as the procedure defined in RFC 6487. Furthermore, this document provides an alternative to Route Origin Authorization (ROA) (RFC 6482) and BGPsec Router Certificate (BGPsec PKI Profiles -- publication requested) validation.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

A Profile for BGPsec Router
Certificates, Certificate Revocation
Lists, and Certification Requests
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8209.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates used to enable validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), as part of an extension to that protocol known as BGPsec.  BGP is the standard for inter-domain routing in the Internet; it is the glue that holds the Internet together.  BGPsec is being developed as one component of a solution that addresses the requirement to provide security for BGP.  The goal of BGPsec is to provide full AS path validation based on the use of strong cryptographic primitives.  The end entity (EE) certificates specified by this profile are issued to routers within an AS.  Each of these certificates is issued under a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Certification Authority (CA) certificate.  These CA certificates and EE certificates both contain the AS Resource extension.  An EE certificate of this type asserts that the router or routers holding the corresponding private key are authorized to emit secure route advertisements on behalf of the AS(es) specified in the certificate.  This document also profiles the format of certification requests and specifies Relying Party (RP) certificate path validation procedures for these EE certificates.  This document extends the RPKI; therefore, this document updates the RPKI Resource Certificates Profile (RFC 6487)."];
