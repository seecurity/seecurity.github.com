CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures

This includes evidence as to its validity even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny (i.e., repudiates) the validity of the signature. The format can be considered as an extension to RFC 3852 and RFC 2634, where, when appropriate, additional signed and unsigned attributes have been defined. The contents of this Informational RFC amount to a transposition of the ETSI Technical Specification (TS) 101 733 V.1.7.4 (CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures -- CAdES) and is technically equivalent to it.

The Signature Validation Token (SVT) defined in this specification provides evidence that asserts the validity of an electronic signature.  The SVT is provided by a trusted authority, which asserts that a particular signature was successfully validated according to defined procedures at a certain time.  Any future validation of that electronic signature can be satisfied by validating the SVT without any need to also validate the original electronic signature or the associated digital certificates.  The SVT supports electronic signatures in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), XML, PDF, and JSON documents."];
