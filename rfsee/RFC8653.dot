WiMAX Forum / 3GPP2 Proxy Mobile IPv4
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5563.html", target="_top", tooltip="Mobile IPv4 is a standard mobility protocol that enables an IPv4 device to move among networks while maintaining its IP address.  The mobile device has the Mobile IPv4 client function to signal its location to the routing anchor, known as the Home Agent.  However, there are many IPv4 devices without such capability due to various reasons.  This document describes Proxy Mobile IPv4 (PMIPv4), a scheme based on having the Mobile IPv4 client function in a network entity to provide mobility support for an unaltered and mobility-unaware IPv4 device.  This document also describes a particular application of PMIPv4 as specified in the WiMAX Forum and another application that is to be adopted in 3GPP2.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Mobility Support in IPv6
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6275.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Mobile IPv6, a protocol that allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.  This document obsoletes RFC 3775. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The protocol provides for registering the care-of address with a home agent.  The home agent sends datagrams destined for the mobile node through a tunnel to the care-of address.  After arriving at the end of the tunnel, each datagram is then delivered to the mobile node. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Requirements for Distributed Mobility
Management
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7333.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the requirements for Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) at the network layer.  The hierarchical structure in traditional wireless networks has led primarily to centrally deployed mobility anchors.  As some wireless networks are evolving away from the hierarchical structure, it can be useful to have a distributed model for mobility management in which traffic does not need to traverse centrally deployed mobility anchors far from the optimal route.  The motivation and the problems addressed by each requirement are also described."];

TCP Extensions for Multipath Operation
with Multiple Addresses
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6824.html", target="_top", tooltip="TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers. The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure. Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

IPv6 Socket API for Source Address
Selection
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5014.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IPv6 default address selection document (RFC 3484) describes the rules for selecting source and destination IPv6 addresses, and indicates that applications should be able to reverse the sense of some of the address selection rules through some unspecified API.  However, no such socket API exists in the basic (RFC 3493) or advanced (RFC 3542) IPv6 socket API documents.  This document fills that gap partially by specifying new socket-level options for source address selection and flags for the getaddrinfo() API to specify address selection based on the source address preference in accordance with the socket-level options that modify the default source address selection algorithm.  The socket API described in this document will be particularly useful for IPv6 applications that want to choose between temporary and public addresses, and for Mobile IPv6 aware applications that want to use the care-of address for communication.  It also specifies socket options and flags for selecting Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) or non-CGA source addresses.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Distributed Mobility Anchoring

A network may be configured with distributed mobility anchoring functions for both network-based or host-based mobility support, depending on the network's needs.  In a distributed mobility anchoring environment, multiple anchors are available for mid-session switching of an IP prefix anchor.  To start a new flow or to handle a flow not requiring IP session continuity as a mobile node moves to a new network, the flow can be started or restarted using an IP address configured from the new IP prefix anchored to the new network.  If the flow needs to survive the change of network, there are solutions that can be used to enable IP address mobility.  This document describes different anchoring approaches, depending on the IP mobility needs, and how this IP address mobility is handled by the network."];
