A Lower Effort Per-Domain Behavior (PDB)
for Differentiated Services
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3662.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document proposes a differentiated services per-domain behavior (PDB) whose traffic may be starved (although starvation is not strictly required) in a properly functioning network.  This is in contrast to the Internet's best-effort or normal Internet traffic model, where prolonged starvation indicates network problems.  In this sense, the proposed PDB's traffic is forwarded with a lower priority than the normal best-effort Internet traffic, thus the PDB is called Lower Effort (LE).  Use of this PDB permits a network operator to strictly limit the effect of its traffic on best-effort/normal or all other Internet traffic.  This document gives some example uses, but does not propose constraining the PDB's use to any particular type of traffic."];

IP Connectivity Provisioning Profile

The CPP defines the set of IP transfer parameters to be supported by the underlying transport network together with a reachability scope and bandwidth/capacity needs. Appropriate performance metrics, such as one-way delay or one-way delay variation, are used to characterize an IP transfer service. Both global and restricted reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP. Such a generic CPP template is meant to (1) facilitate the automation of the service negotiation and activation procedures, thus accelerating service provisioning, (2) set (traffic) objectives of Traffic Engineering functions and service management functions, and (3) improve service and network management systems with 'decision- making' capabilities based upon negotiated/offered CPPs."];
