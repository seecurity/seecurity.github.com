Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol
In-Band Signaling in a Virtual Routing
and Forwarding (VRF) Table Context
2014", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="An IP Multicast Distribution Tree (MDT) may traverse both label switching (i.e., Multiprotocol Label Switching, or MPLS) and non-label switching regions of a network.  Typically, the MDT begins and ends in non-MPLS regions, but travels through an MPLS region.  In such cases, it can be useful to begin building the MDT as a pure IP MDT, then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path (MP-LSP) when it enters an MPLS-enabled region, and then convert it back to a pure IP MDT when it enters a non-MPLS-enabled region.  Other documents specify the procedures for building such a hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) in the non-MPLS region of the network, and using Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol (mLDP) in the MPLS region.  This document extends those procedures to handle the case where the link connecting the two regions is a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) table link, as defined in the BGP IP/MPLS VPN specification.  However, this document is primarily aimed at particular use cases where VRFs are used to support multicast applications other than multicast VPN."];

Multipoint LDP (mLDP) In-Band Signaling

In these scenarios, it can be desirable to convert the IP multicast tree seamlessly into an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path (MP-LSP) when it enters the MPLS domain, and then to convert it back to an IP multicast tree when it exits the MPLS domain.  Previous documents specify procedures that allow certain kinds of IP multicast trees (either Source-Specific Multicast trees or Bidirectional Multicast trees) to be attached to an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path (MP-LSP).  However, the previous documents do not specify procedures for attaching IP Any-Source Multicast trees to MP-LSPs, nor do they specify procedures for aggregating multiple IP multicast trees onto a single MP-LSP.  This document specifies the procedures to support these functions.  It does so by defining wildcard encodings that make it possible to specify, when setting up an MP- LSP, that a set of IP multicast trees, or a shared IP multicast tree, should be attached to that MP-LSP.  Support for non-bidirectional IP Any-Source Multicast trees is subject to certain applicability restrictions that are discussed in this document.  This document updates RFCs 6826 and 7246."];

Multipoint LDP In-Band Signaling for
Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-
Multipoint Label Switched Paths
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6826.html", target="_top", tooltip="Consider an IP multicast tree, constructed by Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM), that needs to pass through an MPLS domain in which Multipoint LDP (mLDP) point-to-multipoint and/or multipoint-to-multipoint Labels Switched Paths (LSPs) can be created.  The part of the IP multicast tree that traverses the MPLS domain can be instantiated as a multipoint LSP.  When a PIM Join message is received at the border of the MPLS domain, information from that message is encoded into mLDP messages.  When the mLDP messages reach the border of the next IP domain, the encoded information is used to generate PIM messages that can be sent through the IP domain.  The result is an IP multicast tree consisting of a set of IP multicast sub-trees that are spliced together with a multipoint LSP.  This document describes procedures regarding how IP multicast trees are spliced together with multipoint LSPs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Bidirectional trees are built using a fail-safe Designated Forwarder (DF) election mechanism operating on each link of a multicast topology.  With the assistance of the DF, multicast data is natively forwarded from sources to the Rendezvous-Point (RP) and hence along the shared tree to receivers without requiring source-specific state.  The DF election takes place at RP discovery time and provides the route to the RP, thus eliminating the requirement for data-driven protocol events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
