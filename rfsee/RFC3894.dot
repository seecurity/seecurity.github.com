Sieve Extension: Copying Without Side
Effects
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Sieve scripting language allows users to control handling and disposal of their incoming e-mail. By default, an e-mail message that is processed by a Sieve script is saved in the owner's inbox. Actions such as fileinto and redirect cancel this default behavior. This document defines a new keyword parameter, :copy, to be used with the Sieve fileinto and redirect actions. Adding :copy to an action suppresses cancellation of the default inbox save. It allows users to add commands to an existing script without changing the meaning of the rest of the script.

Support for Internet Message Access

As defined in the base specification, it plugs into mail delivery.  This document defines how Sieve can plug into points in IMAP where messages are created or changed, adding the option of user-defined or installation-defined filtering (or, with Sieve extensions, features such as notifications).
