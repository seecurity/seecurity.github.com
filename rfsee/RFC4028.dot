Session Timers in the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP)

This extension allows for a periodic refresh of SIP sessions through a \%re-INVITE or UPDATE request.  The refresh allows both user agents and proxies to determine whether the SIP session is still active.  The extension defines two new header fields: \%Session-Expires, which conveys the lifetime of the session, and \%Min-SE, which conveys the minimum allowed value for the session timer.

A Session Description Protocol (SDP)
Offer/Answer Mechanism to Enable File
Transfer
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5547.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides a mechanism to negotiate the transfer of one or more files between two endpoints by using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer model specified in RFC 3264.  SDP is extended to describe the attributes of the files to be transferred.  The offerer can describe either the files it wants to send or the files it would like to receive.  The answerer can either accept or reject the offer separately for each individual file.  The transfer of one or more files is initiated after a successful negotiation.  The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is defined as the default mechanism to actually carry the files between the endpoints.  The conventions on how to use MSRP for file transfer are also provided in this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Session Initiation Protocol Service
Example -- Music on Hold
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7088.html", target="_top", tooltip="Music on hold is one of the features of telephone systems that is most desired by buyers of business telephone systems.  Music on hold means that when one party to a call has the call on hold, that party's telephone provides an audio stream (often music) to be heard by the other party.  Architectural features of SIP make it difficult to implement music on hold in a way that is fully standards-compliant.  The implementation of music on hold described in this document is fully effective, is standards-compliant, and has a number of advantages over the methods previously documented.  In particular, it is less likely to produce peculiar user interface effects and more likely to work in systems that perform authentication than the music-on-hold method described in Section 2.3 of RFC 5359."];
