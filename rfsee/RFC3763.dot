One-way Active Measurement Protocol
(OWAMP) Requirements
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="With growing availability of good time sources to network nodes, it becomes increasingly possible to measure one-way IP performance metrics with high precision.  To do so in an interoperable manner, a common protocol for such measurements is required.  This document specifies requirements for a one-way active measurement protocol (OWAMP) standard.  The protocol can measure one-way delay, as well as other unidirectional characteristics, such as one-way loss.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Packet Reordering Metrics
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4737.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo defines metrics to evaluate whether a network has maintained packet order on a packet-by-packet basis.  It provides motivations for the new metrics and discusses the measurement issues, including the context information required for all metrics.  The memo first defines a reordered singleton, and then uses it as the basis for sample metrics to quantify the extent of reordering in several useful dimensions for network characterization or receiver design.  Additional metrics quantify the frequency of reordering and the distance between separate occurrences.  We then define a metric oriented toward assessment of reordering effects on TCP.  Several examples of evaluation using the various sample metrics are included.  An appendix gives extended definitions for evaluating order with packet fragmentation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Improved Packet Reordering Metrics
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5236.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents two improved metrics for packet reordering, namely, Reorder Density (RD) and Reorder Buffer-occupancy Density (RBD). A threshold is used to clearly define when a packet is considered lost, to bound computational complexity at O(N), and to keep the memory requirement for evaluation independent of N, where N is the length of the packet sequence. RD is a comprehensive metric that captures the characteristics of reordering, while RBD evaluates the sequences from the point of view of recovery from reordering. These metrics are simple to compute yet comprehensive in their characterization of packet reordering. The measures are robust and orthogonal to packet loss and duplication. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
