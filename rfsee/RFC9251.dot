Wildcards in Multicast VPN Auto-
Discovery Routes
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6625.html", target="_top", tooltip="In Multicast Virtual Private Networks (MVPNs), customer multicast flows are carried in tunnels through a service provider's network.  The base specifications for MVPN define BGP multicast VPN auto-discovery routes and specify how to use an auto-discovery route to advertise the fact that an individual customer multicast flow is being carried in a particular tunnel.  However, those specifications do not provide a way to specify, in a single such route, that multiple customer flows are being carried in a single tunnel.  Those specifications also do not provide a way to advertise that a particular tunnel is to be used by default to carry all customer flows, except in the case where that tunnel is joined by all the provider edge routers of the MVPN.  This document eliminates these restrictions by specifying the use of wildcard elements in the customer flow identifiers.  With wildcard elements, a single auto-discovery route can refer to multiple customer flows or even to all customer flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

EVPN Optimized Inter-Subnet Multicast
(OISM) Forwarding
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9625.html", target="_top", tooltip="Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides a service that allows a single Local Area Network (LAN), comprising a single IP subnet, to be divided into multiple segments.  Each segment may be located at a different site, and the segments are interconnected by an IP or MPLS backbone.  Intra-subnet traffic (either unicast or multicast) always appears to the end users to be bridged, even when it is actually carried over the IP or MPLS backbone.  When a single tenant owns multiple such LANs, EVPN also allows IP unicast traffic to be routed between those LANs.  This document specifies new procedures that allow inter-subnet IP multicast traffic to be routed among the LANs of a given tenant while still making intra-subnet IP multicast traffic appear to be bridged.  These procedures can provide optimal routing of the inter-subnet multicast traffic and do not require any such traffic to egress a given router and then ingress that same router.  These procedures also accommodate IP multicast traffic that originates or is destined to be external to the EVPN domain."];

Multicast Source Redundancy in EVPNs

However, the presence of redundant sources can lead to duplicate IP multicast traffic in the network, causing inefficiencies and increased overhead.  This document specifies extensions to the EVPN multicast procedures that allow for the suppression of duplicate IP multicast traffic from redundant sources.  The proposed mechanisms enhance the EVPN's capability to deliver multicast traffic efficiently while maintaining high availability.  These extensions are applicable to various EVPN deployment scenarios and provide guidelines to ensure consistent and predictable behavior across diverse network topologies."];
