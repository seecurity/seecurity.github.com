The Decision Point may be either collocated with the PCN-ingress-node or a centralized node (in the first case, (2) is not required).  The signaling requirements pertain in particular to two edge behaviors, Controlled Load (CL) and Single Marking (SM).

It is not meant to endlessly discuss what SDN truly means but rather to suggest a functional taxonomy of the techniques that can be used under an SDN umbrella and to elaborate on the various pending issues the combined activation of such techniques inevitably raises. As such, a definition of SDN is only mentioned for the sake of clarification."];
