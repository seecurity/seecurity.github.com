Forwarding and Control Element
Separation (ForCES) Model Extension

It also fixes an issue with Logical Functional Block (LFB) inheritance and introduces two new features: a new event condition called eventBecomesEqualTo and LFB properties.  The changes introduced in this memo do not alter the protocol and retain backward compatibility with older LFB models."];
