Selecting Labels for Use with
Conventional DNS and Other Resolution
Systems in DNS-Based Service Discovery
2017", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) can use naming systems other than DNS when looking for services.  Moreover, when it uses DNS, DNS-SD uses the full capability of DNS, rather than using a subset of available octets.  This is of particular relevance where some environments use DNS labels that conform to Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA), and other environments use labels containing Unicode characters (such as containing octets corresponding to characters encoded as UTF-8).  In order for DNS-SD to be used effectively in environments where multiple different name systems and conventions for their operation are in use, it is important to attend to differences in the underlying technology and operational environment.  This memo presents an outline of the requirements for the selection of labels for conventional DNS and other resolution systems when they are expected to interoperate in this manner.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Multicast DNS
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6762.html", target="_top", tooltip="As networked devices become smaller, more portable, and more ubiquitous, the ability to operate with less configured infrastructure is increasingly important. In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including, but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server is useful. Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server. In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use, without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names. The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work when no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure failures."];
