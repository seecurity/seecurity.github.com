The SIP REFER method defined in RFC 3515 provides a mechanism that allows one party to induce another to initiate a SIP request.  This document extends the REFER method to use the mechanism of RFC 3840.  By doing so, the originator of a REFER may inform the recipient as to the characteristics of the target that the induced request is expected to reach.

2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8217.html", target="_top", tooltip="RFC 3261 constrained several SIP header fields whose grammar contains the name-addr / addr-spec alternative to use name-addr when certain characters appear. Unfortunately, it expressed the constraints with prose copied into each header field definition, and at least one header field was missed. Further, the constraint has not been copied into documents defining extension headers whose grammar contains the alternative. This document updates RFC 3261 to state the constraint generically and clarifies that the constraint applies to all SIP header fields where there is a choice between using name-addr or addr-spec. It also updates the RFCs that define extension SIP header fields using the alternative to clarify that the constraint applies (RFCs 3325, 3515, 3892, 4508, 5002, 5318, 5360, and 5502)."];

It can be difficult to locate the right document, or even to determine the set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP.  This specification serves as a guide to the SIP RFC series.  It lists a current snapshot of the specifications under the SIP umbrella, briefly summarizes each, and groups them into categories.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
