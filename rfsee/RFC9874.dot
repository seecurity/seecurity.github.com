Best Practices for Deletion of Domain

Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) includes commands for clients to delete domain and host objects, both of which are used to publish information in the Domain Name System (DNS).  EPP also includes guidance for deletions that is intended to avoid DNS resolution disruptions and maintain data consistency.  However, operational relationships between objects can make that guidance difficult to implement.  Some EPP clients have developed operational practices to delete those objects that have unintended impacts on DNS resolution and security.  This document describes best current practices and proposes new potential practices to delete domain and host objects that reduce the risk of DNS resolution failure and maintain client-server data consistency.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

I'm Being Attacked by PRISONER.IANA.ORG!
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6305.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses that are not globally unique. Examples are the addresses designated in RFC 1918 for private use within individual sites. Hosts should never normally send DNS reverse-mapping queries for those addresses on the public Internet. However, such queries are frequently observed. Authoritative servers are deployed to provide authoritative answers to such queries as part of a loosely coordinated effort known as the AS112 project. Since queries sent to AS112 servers are usually not intentional, the replies received back from those servers are typically unexpected. Unexpected inbound traffic can trigger alarms on intrusion detection systems and firewalls, and operators of such systems often mistakenly believe that they are being attacked. This document provides background information and technical advice to those firewall operators. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Negative Caching of DNS Resolution
Failures
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9520.html", target="_top", tooltip="In the DNS, resolvers employ caching to reduce both latency for end users and load on authoritative name servers. The process of resolution may result in one of three types of responses: (1) a response containing the requested data, (2) a response indicating the requested data does not exist, or (3) a non-response due to a resolution failure in which the resolver does not receive any useful information regarding the data's existence. This document concerns itself only with the third type. RFC 2308 specifies requirements for DNS negative caching. There, caching of TYPE 2 responses is mandatory and caching of TYPE 3 responses is optional. This document updates RFC 2308 to require negative caching for DNS resolution failures. RFC 4035 allows DNSSEC validation failure caching. This document updates RFC 4035 to require caching for DNSSEC validation failures. RFC 4697 prohibits aggressive requerying for NS records at a failed zone's parent zone. This document updates RFC 4697 to expand this requirement to all query types and to all ancestor zones."];
