Recommendations for Chinese Domain Names

Internationalizing Domain Names in
Applications (IDNA)
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3490.html", target="_top", tooltip="Until now, there has been no standard method for domain names to use characters outside the ASCII repertoire.  This document defines internationalized domain names (IDNs) and a mechanism called Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) for handling them in a standard fashion.  IDNs use characters drawn from a large repertoire (Unicode), but IDNA allows the non-ASCII characters to be represented using only the ASCII characters already allowed in so-called host names today.  This backward-compatible representation is required in existing protocols like DNS, so that IDNs can be introduced with no changes to the existing infrastructure.  IDNA is only meant for processing domain names, not free text. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Punycode: A Bootstring encoding of

It uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into an ASCII string.  ASCII characters in the Unicode string are represented literally, and non-ASCII characters are represented by ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters, digits, and hyphens).  This document defines a general algorithm called Bootstring that allows a string of basic code points to uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger set.  Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that uses particular parameter values specified by this document, appropriate for IDNA. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Suggested Practices for Registration of
Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4290.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document explores the issues in the registration of internationalized domain names (IDNs).  The basic IDN definition allows a very large number of possible characters in domain names, and this richness may lead to serious user confusion about similar-looking names.  To avoid this confusion, the IDN registration process must impose rules that disallow some otherwise-valid name combinations.  This document suggests a set of mechanisms that registries might use to define and implement such rules for a broad range of languages, including adaptation of methods developed for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean domain names.

Joint Engineering Team (JET) Guidelines
for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)
Registration and Administration for
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3743.html", target="_top", tooltip="Achieving internationalized access to domain names raises many complex issues.  These are associated not only with basic protocol design, such as how names are represented on the network, compared, and converted to appropriate forms, but also with issues and options for deployment, transition, registration, and administration.  The IETF Standards for Internationalized Domain Names, known as IDNA, focuses on access to domain names in a range of scripts that is broader in scope than the original ASCII.  The development process made it clear that use of characters with similar appearances and/or interpretations created potential for confusion, as well as difficulties in deployment and transition.  The conclusion was that, while those issues were important, they could best be addressed administratively rather than through restrictions embedded in the protocols.  This document defines a set of guidelines for applying restrictions of that type for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) scripts and the zones that use them and, perhaps, the beginning of a framework for thinking about other zones, languages, and scripts.

Because of Unicode decisions, appearance, language and writing system conventions, and historical reasons, it often has been asserted that there is more than one way to write what competent readers and writers think of as the same host name; these different ways of writing are often called variants. (The authors note that there are many conflicting definitions for the term variant in the IDNA community.) This document surveys the approaches that top-level domains have taken to the registration and provisioning of domain names that have variants.  This document is not a product of the IETF, does not propose any method to make variants work correctly, and is not an introduction to internationalization or IDNA."];
