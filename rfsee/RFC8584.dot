When a single tenant owns multiple such LANs, EVPN also allows IP unicast traffic to be routed between those LANs.  This document specifies new procedures that allow inter-subnet IP multicast traffic to be routed among the LANs of a given tenant while still making intra-subnet IP multicast traffic appear to be bridged.
