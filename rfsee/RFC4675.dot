One MIB module defines objects for managing the 'Traffic Classes' and 'Enhanced Multicast Filtering' components of IEEE 802.1D-1998 and P802.1t-2001 (TM). The other MIB module defines objects for managing VLANs, as specified in IEEE 802.1Q-2003, P802.1u (TM), and P802.1v (TM). Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging. Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments. This memo supplements RFC 4188 and obsoletes RFC 2674. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Initial deployments of the Diameter protocol are expected to include legacy systems. Therefore, this application has been carefully designed to ease the burden of protocol conversion between RADIUS and Diameter. This is achieved by including the RADIUS attribute space to eliminate the need to perform many attribute translations. The interactions between Diameter applications and RADIUS specified in this document are to be applied to all Diameter applications. In this sense, this document extends the Base Diameter protocol.

This Diameter application allows external devices to configure and manage a Network Address Translator device -- expanding the existing Diameter-based Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) and policy control capabilities with a Network Address Translator and Network Address and Port Translator control component.  These external devices can be network elements in the data plane such as a Network Access Server, or can be more centralized control plane devices such as AAA-servers.  This Diameter application establishes a context to commonly identify and manage endpoints on a gateway or server and a Network Address Translator and Network Address and Port Translator device.  This includes, for example, the control of the total number of Network Address Translator bindings allowed or the allocation of a specific Network Address Translator binding for a particular endpoint.  In addition, it allows Network Address Translator devices to provide information relevant to accounting purposes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
