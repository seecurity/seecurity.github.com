Internet
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9340.html", target="_top", tooltip="The vision of a quantum internet is to enhance existing Internet technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth.  To achieve this goal, a quantum network stack should be built from the ground up to account for the fundamentally new properties of quantum entanglement.  The first quantum entanglement networks have been realised, but there is no practical proposal for how to organise, utilise, and manage such networks.  In this document, we attempt to lay down the framework and introduce some basic architectural principles for a quantum internet.  This is intended for general guidance and general interest.  It is also intended to provide a foundation for discussion between physicists and network specialists.  This document is a product of the Quantum Internet Research Group (QIRG)."];

Maintaining Robust Protocols
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9413.html", target="_top", tooltip="The main goal of the networking standards process is to enable the long-term interoperability of protocols. This document describes active protocol maintenance, a means to accomplish that goal. By evolving specifications and implementations, it is possible to reduce ambiguity over time and create a healthy ecosystem. The robustness principle, often phrased as be conservative in what you send, and liberal in what you accept, has long guided the design and implementation of Internet protocols. However, it has been interpreted in a variety of ways. While some interpretations help ensure the health of the Internet, others can negatively affect interoperability over time. When a protocol is actively maintained, protocol designers and implementers can avoid these pitfalls."];
