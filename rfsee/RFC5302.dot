Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution with
Two-Level IS-IS
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes extensions to the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol to support optimal routing within a two-level domain. The IS-IS protocol is specified in ISO 10589, with extensions for supporting IPv4 (Internet Protocol) specified in RFC 1195. This document replaces RFC 2966. This document extends the semantics presented in RFC 1195 so that a routing domain running with both level 1 and level 2 Intermediate Systems (IS) (routers) can distribute IP prefixes between level 1 and level 2, and vice versa. This distribution requires certain restrictions to ensure that persistent forwarding loops do not form. The goal of this domain-wide prefix distribution is to increase the granularity of the routing information within the domain. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

IS-IS Flood Reflection
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9377.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a backward-compatible, optional IS-IS extension that allows the creation of IS-IS flood reflection topologies.  Flood reflection permits topologies in which IS-IS Level 1 (L1) areas provide transit-forwarding for IS-IS Level 2 (L2) areas using all available L1 nodes internally.  It accomplishes this by creating L2 flood reflection adjacencies within each L1 area.  Those adjacencies are used to flood L2 Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) and are used in the L2 Shortest Path First (SPF) computation.  However, they are not ordinarily utilized for forwarding within the flood reflection cluster.  This arrangement gives the L2 topology significantly better scaling properties than prevalently used flat designs.  As an additional benefit, only those routers directly participating in flood reflection are required to support the feature.  This allows for incremental deployment of scalable L1 transit areas in an existing, previously flat network design, without the necessity of upgrading all routers in the network."];
