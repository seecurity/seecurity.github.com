IPv6 Unicast Address Assignment
Considerations
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5375.html", target="_top", tooltip="One fundamental aspect of any IP communications infrastructure is its addressing plan.  With its new address architecture and allocation policies, the introduction of IPv6 into a network means that network designers and operators need to reconsider their existing approaches to network addressing.  Lack of guidelines on handling this aspect of network design could slow down the deployment and integration of IPv6.  This document aims to provide the information and recommendations relevant to planning the addressing aspects of IPv6 deployments.  The document also provides IPv6 addressing case studies for both an enterprise and an ISP network.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

One issue is with the handling of multi-destination packet distribution trees. Other issues are with TRILL switch nicknames. How are such nicknames allocated across a multilevel TRILL network? Do nicknames need to be unique across an entire multilevel TRILL network? Or can they merely be unique within each multilevel area? This informational document enumerates and examines alternatives based on a number of factors including backward compatibility, simplicity, and scalability; it makes recommendations in some cases."];
