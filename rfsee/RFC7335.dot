Stateless IP/ICMP Translation for IPv6
Internet Data Center Environments (SIIT-
DC): Dual Translation Mode
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7756.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes an extension of the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation for IPv6 Internet Data Center Environments (SIIT-DC) architecture, which allows applications, protocols, or nodes that are incompatible with IPv6 and/or Network Address Translation to operate correctly with SIIT-DC. This is accomplished by introducing a new component called an SIIT-DC Edge Relay, which reverses the translations made by an SIIT-DC Border Relay. The application and/or node is thus provided with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity that provides end-to-end address transparency. The reader is expected to be familiar with the SIIT-DC architecture described in RFC 7755."];
