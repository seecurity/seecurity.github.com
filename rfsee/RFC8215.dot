IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators

It defines a well-known prefix for use in algorithmic translations, while allowing organizations to also use network-specific prefixes when appropriate.  Algorithmic translation is used in IPv4/IPv6 translators, as well as other types of proxies and gateways (e.g., for DNS) used in IPv4/IPv6 scenarios. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Stateful NAT64: Network Address and

One or more public IPv4 addresses assigned to a NAT64 translator are shared among several IPv6-only clients.  When stateful NAT64 is used in conjunction with DNS64, no changes are usually required in the IPv6 client or the IPv4 server."];
