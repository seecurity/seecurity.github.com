Implicit Initialization Vector (IV) for
Counter-Based Ciphers in Encapsulating
Security Payload (ESP)
2020", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) sends an initialization vector (IV) in each packet.  The size of the IV depends on the applied transform and is usually 8 or 16 octets for the transforms defined at the time this document was written.  When used with IPsec, some algorithms, such as AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and ChaCha20-Poly1305, take the IV to generate a nonce that is used as an input parameter for encrypting and decrypting.  This IV must be unique but can be predictable.  As a result, the value provided in the ESP Sequence Number (SN) can be used instead to generate the nonce.  This avoids sending the IV itself and saves 8 octets per packet in the case of AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and ChaCha20-Poly1305.  This document describes how to do this."];
