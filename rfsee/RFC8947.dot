Link-Layer Address Assignment Mechanism
for DHCPv6
2020", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In certain environments, e.g., large-scale virtualization deployments, new devices are created in an automated manner.  Such devices may have their link-layer addresses assigned in an automated fashion.  With sufficient scale, the likelihood of a collision using random assignment without duplication detection is not acceptable.  Therefore, an allocation mechanism is required.  This document proposes an extension to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable approach to link-layer address assignments where preassigned link-layer address assignments (such as by a manufacturer) are not possible or are unnecessary.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for

2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8415.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6): an extensible mechanism for configuring nodes with network configuration parameters, IP addresses, and prefixes. Parameters can be provided statelessly, or in combination with stateful assignment of one or more IPv6 addresses and/or IPv6 prefixes. DHCPv6 can operate either in place of or in addition to stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC). This document updates the text from RFC 3315 (the original DHCPv6 specification) and incorporates prefix delegation (RFC 3633), stateless DHCPv6 (RFC 3736), an option to specify an upper bound for how long a client should wait before refreshing information (RFC 4242), a mechanism for throttling DHCPv6 clients when DHCPv6 service is not available (RFC 7083), and relay agent handling of unknown messages (RFC 7283). In addition, this document clarifies the interactions between models of operation (RFC 7550).
