Anonymous Simple Authentication and
Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="On the Internet, it is common practice to permit anonymous access to various services.  Traditionally, this has been done with a plain-text password mechanism using anonymous as the user name and using optional trace information, such as an email address, as the password.  As plain-text login commands are not permitted in new IETF protocols, a new way to provide anonymous login is needed within the context of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.

This document details establishment of Transport Layer Security (TLS) using the StartTLS operation.

This document discusses various authentication and authorization states through which a session to an LDAP server may pass and the actions that trigger these state changes.

Stringprep Revision and Problem
Statement for the Preparation and
Comparison of Internationalized Strings
(PRECIS)
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6885.html", target="_top", tooltip="If a protocol expects to compare two strings and is prepared only for those strings to be ASCII, then using Unicode code points in those strings requires they be prepared somehow.  Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (here called IDNA2003) defined and used Stringprep and Nameprep.  Other protocols subsequently defined Stringprep profiles.  A new approach different from Stringprep and Nameprep is used for a revision of IDNA2003 (called IDNA2008).  Other Stringprep profiles need to be similarly updated, or a replacement of Stringprep needs to be designed.  This document outlines the issues to be faced by those designing a Stringprep replacement."];
