DNS Attrleaf Changes: Fixing
Specifications That Use Underscored Node

Original uses of an underscore character as a domain node name prefix were specified without the benefit of an IANA registry.

However, the existing specifications that use underscored naming need to be modified in order to be in line with the new registry.  This document specifies those changes.
