What's in a Name: False Assumptions
about DNS Names
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Domain Name System (DNS) provides an essential service on the Internet, mapping structured names to a variety of data, usually IP addresses.  These names appear in email addresses, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), and other application-layer identifiers that are often rendered to human users.  Because of this, there has been a strong demand to acquire names that have significance to people, through equivalence to registered trademarks, company names, types of services, and so on.  There is a danger in this trend; the humans and automata that consume and use such names will associate specific semantics with some names and thereby make assumptions about the services that are, or should be, provided by the hosts associated with the names.  Those assumptions can often be false, resulting in a variety of failure conditions.  This document discusses this problem in more detail and makes recommendations on how it can be avoided.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Architectural Considerations on
Application Features in the DNS
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6950.html", target="_top", tooltip="A number of Internet applications rely on the Domain Name System (DNS) to support their operations.  Many applications use the DNS to locate services for a domain; some, for example, transform identifiers other than domain names into formats that the DNS can process, and then fetch application data or service location data from the DNS.  Proposals incorporating sophisticated application behavior using DNS as a substrate have raised questions about the role of the DNS as an application platform.  This document explores the architectural consequences of using the DNS to implement certain application features, and it provides guidance to future application designers as to the limitations of the DNS as a substrate and the situations in which alternative designs should be considered."];
