Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult. This document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for generating such quantities.

Secure Object Delivery Protocol (SODP)
Server Interfaces: NSA's Profile for
Delivery of Certificates, Certificate
Revocation Lists (CRLs), and Symmetric
Keys to Clients
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9152.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies protocol interfaces profiled by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) for National Security System (NSS) servers that provide public key certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and symmetric keys to NSS clients. Servers that support these interfaces are referred to as Secure Object Delivery Protocol (SODP) servers. The intended audience for this profile comprises developers of client devices that will obtain key management services from NSA-operated SODP servers. Interfaces supported by SODP servers include Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) and its extensions as well as Certificate Management over CMS (CMC). This profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of US National Security Systems (SP 800-59). It is also appropriate for other US Government systems that process high-value information. It is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments."];

Clarification and Enhancement of the CSR
Attributes Definition in RFC 7030
2026", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9908.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document updates RFC 7030, Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST), clarifying how the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Attributes Response can be used by an EST server to specify both CSR attribute Object Identifiers (OIDs) and CSR attribute values, particularly X.509 extension values, that the server expects the client to include in a subsequent CSR request. RFC 9148 is derived from RFC 7030 and is also updated. RFC 7030 is ambiguous in its specification of the CSR Attributes Response. This has resulted in implementation challenges and implementor confusion because there was no universal understanding of what was specified. This document clarifies the encoding rules. This document also provides a new straightforward approach: using a template for CSR contents that may be partially filled in by the server. This also allows an EST server to specify a subject Distinguished Name (DN)."];
