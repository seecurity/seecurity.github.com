Link Relation Types for Web Services

Often, these sets of resources are referred to as Web services or Web APIs.

Documentation is primarily intended for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily intended for automated consumers.  Metadata provides information about a service's context.  This specification also defines a link relation to identify status resources that are used to represent information about service status.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
