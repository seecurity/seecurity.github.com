Extended Mobility Procedures for
Ethernet VPN Integrated Routing and
Bridging (EVPN-IRB)
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies extensions to the Ethernet VPN Integrated Routing and Bridging (EVPN-IRB) procedures specified in RFCs 7432 and 9135 to enhance the mobility mechanisms for networks based on EVPN-IRB.  The proposed extensions improve the handling of host mobility and duplicate address detection in EVPN-IRB networks to cover a broader set of scenarios where a host's unicast IP address to Media Access Control (MAC) address bindings may change across moves.  These enhancements address limitations in the existing EVPN-IRB mobility procedures by providing more efficient and scalable solutions.  The extensions are backward compatible with existing EVPN-IRB implementations and aim to optimize network performance in scenarios involving frequent IP address mobility.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
