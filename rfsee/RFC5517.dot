Cisco Systems' Private VLANs: Scalable
Security in a Multi-Client Environment
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism to achieve device isolation through the application of special Layer 2 forwarding constraints. Such a mechanism allows end devices to share the same IP subnet while being Layer 2 isolated, which in turn allows network designers to employ larger subnets and so reduce the address management overhead. Some of the numerous deployment scenarios of the aforementioned mechanism (which range from data center designs to Ethernet-to-the-home-basement networks) are mentioned in the following text to exemplify the mechanism's possible usages; however, this document is not intended to cover all such deployment scenarios nor delve into their details.

MAC-Forced Forwarding: A Method for
Subscriber Separation on an Ethernet
Access Network
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4562.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism to ensure layer-2 separation of Local Area Network (LAN) stations accessing an IPv4 gateway over a bridged Ethernet segment. The mechanism - called MAC-Forced Forwarding - implements an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) proxy function that prohibits Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) address resolution between hosts located within the same IPv4 subnet but at different customer premises, and in effect directs all upstream traffic to an IPv4 gateway. The IPv4 gateway provides IP-layer connectivity between these same hosts. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Neighbor Discovery Considerations in
IPv6 Deployments
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9898.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol is a critical component of the
IPv6 architecture. The protocol uses multicast in many messages. It
also assumes a security model where all nodes on a link are trusted.
Such a design might be inefficient in some scenarios (e.g., use of
multicast in wireless networks) or when nodes are not trustworthy
(e.g., public access networks). These security and operational issues
and the associated mitigation solutions are documented in more than
twenty RFCs. There is a need to track these issues and solutions in a
single document. To that aim, this document summarizes the published ND issues and
then describes how all these issues originate from three causes.
Addressing the issues is made simpler by addressing the causes. This
document also analyzes the mitigation solutions and demonstrates that
isolating hosts into different subnets and links can help to address
the three causes. Guidance is provided for selecting a suitable
isolation method to prevent potential ND issues."];
