The framework provides a means to deliver profile data that user agents need to be functional, automatically and with minimal or no User and Administrative intervention.  The framework describes how SIP user agents can discover sources, request profiles, and receive notifications related to profile modifications.  As part of this framework, a new SIP event package is defined for notification of profile changes.  The framework provides minimal data retrieval options to ensure interoperability.  The framework does not include specification of the profile data within its scope. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Sieve Extension: Externally Stored Lists

Currently, this requires that all members of such lists be hard-coded in the script itself. Whenever a member of a list is added or deleted, the script needs to be updated and possibly uploaded to a mail server.

Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
Mutual Cryptographic Binding
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7029.html", target="_top", tooltip="As the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) evolves, EAP peers rely increasingly on information received from the EAP server.  EAP extensions such as channel binding or network posture information are often carried in tunnel methods; peers are likely to rely on this information.  Cryptographic binding is a facility described in RFC 3748 that protects tunnel methods against man-in-the-middle attacks.  However, cryptographic binding focuses on protecting the server rather than the peer.  This memo explores attacks possible when the peer is not protected from man-in-the-middle attacks and recommends cryptographic binding based on an Extended Master Session Key, a new form of cryptographic binding that protects both peer and server along with other mitigations."];
