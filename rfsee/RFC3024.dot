Mobile IPv4 Regional Registration
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4857.html", target="_top", tooltip="Using Mobile IP, a mobile node registers with its home agent each time it changes care-of address.  This document describes a new kind of regional registrations, i.e., registrations local to the visited domain.  The regional registrations are performed via a new network entity called a Gateway Foreign Agent (GFA) and introduce a layer of hierarchy in the visited domain.  Regional registrations reduce the number of signaling messages to the home network, and reduce the signaling delay when a mobile node moves from one foreign agent to another within the same visited domain.  This document is an optional extension to the Mobile IPv4 protocol.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Secure Connectivity and Mobility Using
Mobile IPv4 and IKEv2 Mobility and
Multihoming (MOBIKE)
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5266.html", target="_top", tooltip="Enterprise users require mobility and secure connectivity when they roam and connect to the services offered in the enterprise.  Secure connectivity is required when the user connects to the enterprise from an untrusted network.  Mobility is beneficial when the user moves, either inside or outside the enterprise network, and acquires a new IP address.  This document describes a solution using Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) and mobility extensions to IKEv2 (MOBIKE) to provide secure connectivity and mobility.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];

WiMAX Forum / 3GPP2 Proxy Mobile IPv4
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5563.html", target="_top", tooltip="Mobile IPv4 is a standard mobility protocol that enables an IPv4 device to move among networks while maintaining its IP address.  The mobile device has the Mobile IPv4 client function to signal its location to the routing anchor, known as the Home Agent.  However, there are many IPv4 devices without such capability due to various reasons.  This document describes Proxy Mobile IPv4 (PMIPv4), a scheme based on having the Mobile IPv4 client function in a network entity to provide mobility support for an unaltered and mobility-unaware IPv4 device.  This document also describes a particular application of PMIPv4 as specified in the WiMAX Forum and another application that is to be adopted in 3GPP2.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) Key
Extension for Mobile IPv4
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6245.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) specification contains a Key field, which MAY contain a value that is used to identify a particular GRE data stream.  This specification defines a new Mobile IP extension that is used to exchange the value to be used in the GRE Key field.  This extension further allows the Mobility Agents to set up the necessary protocol interfaces prior to receiving the mobile node traffic.  The new extension allows a Foreign Agent to request GRE tunneling without disturbing the Home Agent behavior specified for Mobile IPv4.  GRE tunneling with the Key field allows the operators to have home networks that consist of multiple Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which may have overlapping home addresses.  When the tuple <Care of Address, Home Address, and Home Agent Address> is the same across multiple subscriber sessions, GRE tunneling will provide a means for the Foreign Agent and Home Agent to identify data streams for the individual sessions based on the GRE key.  In the absence of this key identifier, the data streams cannot be distinguished from each other -- a significant drawback when using IP-in-IP tunneling. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
