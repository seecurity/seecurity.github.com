Guidance on Designing Label Generation
Rulesets (LGRs) Supporting Variant
Labels

This document describes ways to design LGRs to support variant labels.  In designing LGRs, it is important to ensure that the label generation rules are consistent and well behaved in the presence of variants.  The design decisions can then be expressed using the XML representation of LGRs that is defined in RFC 7940."];
