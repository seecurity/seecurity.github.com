Virtual Ethernet Segments for EVPN and
Provider Backbone Bridge EVPN
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Ethernet VPN (EVPN) and Provider Backbone Bridge EVPN (PBB-EVPN) introduce a comprehensive suite of solutions for delivering Ethernet services over MPLS/IP networks.  These solutions offer advanced multihoming capabilities.  Specifically, they support Single-Active and All-Active redundancy modes for an Ethernet Segment (ES), which is defined as a collection of physical links connecting a multihomed device or network to a set of Provider Edge (PE) devices.  This document extends the concept of an ES by allowing an ES to be associated with a set of Ethernet Virtual Circuits (EVCs), such as VLANs, or other entities, including MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) or pseudowires (PWs).  This extended concept is referred to as virtual Ethernet Segments (vESes).  This document lists the requirements and specifies the necessary extensions to support vES in both EVPN and PBB-EVPN."];

The Designated Forwarder is selected out of a candidate list of PEs that advertise the same Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) to the EVPN network, according to the default DF election algorithm. While the default algorithm provides an efficient and automated way of selecting the Designated Forwarder across different Ethernet Tags in the Ethernet Segment, there are some use cases where a more deterministic and user-controlled method is required. At the same time, Network Operators require an easy way to force an on-demand Designated Forwarder switchover in order to carry out some maintenance tasks on the existing Designated Forwarder or control whether a new active PE can preempt the existing Designated Forwarder PE.
