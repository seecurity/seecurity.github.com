Security Event Token (SET)

A SET describes statements of fact from the perspective of an issuer about a subject.  These statements of fact represent an event that occurred directly to or about a security subject, for example, a statement about the issuance or revocation of a token on behalf of a subject.  This specification is intended to enable representing security- and identity-related events.  A SET is a JSON Web Token (JWT), which can be optionally signed and/or encrypted.

Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):

The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier.

The cryptographic signature is defined with the intention that it can confidently verify the originating persona even when the signature is sent to the destination party over an insecure channel.
