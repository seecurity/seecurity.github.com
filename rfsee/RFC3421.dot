Select and Sort Extensions for the
Service Location Protocol (SLP)

These extensions allow a User Agent (UA) to request that the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) entries in a Service Reply (SrvRply) be limited to the specified number, or be sorted according to the specified sort key list.  Using these two extensions together can facilitate discovering the best match, such as finding a service that has the maximum speed or the minimum load.

Using this protocol, computers using the Internet need little or no static configuration of network services for network based applications.
