Requesting Answering Modes for the
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document extends SIP with two header fields and associated option tags that can be used in INVITE requests to convey the requester's preference for user-interface handling related to answering of that request.  The first header, Answer-Mode, expresses a preference as to whether the target node's user interface waits for user input before accepting the request or, instead, accepts the request without waiting on user input.  The second header, Priv-Answer-Mode, is similar to the first, except that it requests administrative-level access and has consequent additional authentication and authorization requirements.  These behaviors have applicability to applications such as push-to-talk and to diagnostics like loop-back.  Usage of each header field in a response to indicate how the request was handled is also defined. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A Call Control and Multi-Party Usage
Framework for the Session Initiation

To enable discussion of multi-party features and applications, we define an abstract call model for describing the media relationships required by many of these.  The model and actions described here are specifically chosen to be independent of the SIP signaling and/or mixing approach chosen to actually set up the media relationships.  In addition to its dialog manipulation aspect, this framework includes requirements for communicating related information and events such as conference and session state and session history.  This framework also describes other goals that embody the spirit of SIP applications as used on the Internet such as the definition of primitives (not services), invoker and participant oriented primitives, signaling and mixing model independence, and others.
