Linux Netlink as an IP Services Protocol
2003", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes Linux Netlink, which is used in Linux both as an intra-kernel messaging system as well as between kernel and user space.  The focus of this document is to describe Netlink's functionality as a protocol between a Forwarding Engine Component (FEC) and a Control Plane Component (CPC), the two components that define an IP service.  As a result of this focus, this document ignores other uses of Netlink, including its use as a intra-kernel messaging system, as an inter- process communication scheme (IPC), or as a configuration tool for other non-networking or non-IP network services (such as decnet, etc.).  This document is intended as informational in the context of prior art for the ForCES IETF working group.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
