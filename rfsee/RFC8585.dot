Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge

The document only covers IPv4aaS, i.e., transition technologies for delivering IPv4 in IPv6-only access networks. IPv4aaS is necessary because there aren't sufficient IPv4 addresses available for every possible customer/ device. However, devices or applications in the customer Local Area Networks (LANs) may be IPv4-only or IPv6-only and still need to communicate with IPv4-only services on the Internet."];
