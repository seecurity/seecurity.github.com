Application Bridging for Federated

Application Bridging for Federated
Access Beyond Web (ABFAB) Architecture
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7831.html", target="_top", tooltip="Over the last decade, a substantial amount of work has occurred in the space of federated access management. Most of this effort has focused on two use cases: network access and web-based access. However, the solutions to these use cases that have been proposed and deployed tend to have few building blocks in common. This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non-federated access management, including the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). The architecture addresses the problem of federated access management to primarily non-web-based services, in a manner that will scale to large numbers of Identity Providers, Relying Parties, and federations."];

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5321.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document is a specification of the basic protocol for Internet electronic mail transport.  It consolidates, updates, and clarifies several previous documents, making all or parts of most of them obsolete.  It covers the SMTP extension mechanisms and best practices for the contemporary Internet, but does not provide details about particular extensions.  Although SMTP was designed as a mail transport and delivery protocol, this specification also contains information that is important to its use as a mail submission protocol for split-UA (User Agent) mail reading systems and mobile environments.

INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL -
VERSION 4rev1
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3501.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.  IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders.  IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server.  IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC 2822 and RFC 2045 parsing, searching, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of numbers.  These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers.  IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A mechanism for accessing configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is discussed in RFC 2244.  IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as RFC 2821. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol
Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the SSH protocol, as well as the notation and terminology used in SSH protocol documents.  It also discusses the SSH algorithm naming system that allows local extensions.  The SSH protocol consists of three major components: The Transport Layer Protocol provides server authentication, confidentiality, and integrity with perfect forward secrecy.  The User Authentication Protocol authenticates the client to the server.  The Connection Protocol multiplexes the encrypted tunnel into several logical channels.  Details of these protocols are described in separate documents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Standard certificate extensions are described and two Internet-specific extensions are defined.  A set of required certificate extensions is specified.  The X.509 v2 CRL format is described in detail along with standard and Internet-specific extensions.  An algorithm for X.509 certification path validation is described.

RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time
Applications
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3550.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.
