LDP IGP Synchronization
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5443.html", target="_top", tooltip="In certain networks, there is dependency on the edge-to-edge Label Switched Paths (LSPs) setup by the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), e.g., networks that are used for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications.  For such applications, it is not possible to rely on Internet Protocol (IP) forwarding if the MPLS LSP is not operating appropriately.  Blackholing of labeled traffic can occur in situations where the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) is operational on a link on which LDP is not.  While the link could still be used for IP forwarding, it is not useful for MPLS forwarding, for example, MPLS VPN applications or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route-free cores.  This document describes a mechanism to avoid traffic loss due to this condition without introducing any protocol changes.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

LDP IGP Synchronization for Broadcast
Networks
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6138.html", target="_top", tooltip="RFC 5443 describes a mechanism to achieve LDP IGP synchronization to prevent black-holing traffic (e.g., VPN) when an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) is operational on a link but Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is not.  If this mechanism is applied to broadcast links that have more than one LDP peer, the metric increase procedure can only be applied to the link as a whole but not to an individual peer.  When a new LDP peer comes up on a broadcast network, this can result in loss of traffic through other established peers on that network.  This document describes a mechanism to address that use-case without dropping traffic.  The mechanism does not introduce any protocol message changes.

Guidelines for Writing an IANA

To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed.
