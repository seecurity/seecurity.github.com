Dynamic Placement of Multi-Segment
Pseudowires
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7267.html", target="_top", tooltip="RFC 5254 describes the service provider requirements for extending the reach of pseudowires (PWs) across multiple Packet Switched Network domains.  A multi-segment PW is defined as a set of two or more contiguous PW segments that behave and function as a single point-to-point PW.  This document describes extensions to the PW control protocol to dynamically place the segments of the multi-segment pseudowire among a set of Provider Edge (PE) routers.  This document also updates RFC 6073 by updating the value of the Length field of the PW Switching Point PE Sub-TLV Type 0x06 to 14."];

Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using
the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)

It is also possible to use pseudowires to provide low-rate Time Division Multiplexed and a Synchronous Optical NETworking circuit emulation over an MPLS-enabled network.  This document specifies a protocol for establishing and maintaining the pseudowires, using extensions to Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).  Procedures for encapsulating Layer 2 PDUs are specified in a set of companion documents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

LDP Specification
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5036.html", target="_top", tooltip="The architecture for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is described in RFC 3031.  A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through them.  This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has made.  This document defines a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths.

This document defines AII structures in the form of new AII TLV fields that support AII aggregation for improved scalability and Virtual Private Network (VPN) auto-discovery.  It is envisioned that this would be useful in large inter-domain virtual private wire service networks where pseudowires are established between selected local and remote provider edge (PE) nodes based on customer need.

The different PW control plane domains may belong to independent autonomous systems, or the PSN technology is heterogeneous, or a PW might need to be aggregated at a specific PSN point.  The PW packet data units are simply switched from one PW to another without changing the PW payload. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
