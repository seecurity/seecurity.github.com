Registration for Multiple Phone Numbers
in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines a mechanism by which a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server acting as a traditional Private Branch Exchange (PBX) can register with a SIP Service Provider (SSP) to receive phone calls for SIP User Agents (UAs).  In order to function properly, this mechanism requires that each of the Addresses of Record (AORs) registered in bulk map to a unique set of contacts.  This requirement is satisfied by AORs representing phone numbers regardless of the domain, since phone numbers are fully qualified and globally unique.  This document therefore focuses on this use case. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Event Package for Registrations
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3680.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package for registrations.  Through its REGISTER method, SIP allows a user agent to create, modify, and delete registrations.  Registrations can also be altered by administrators in order to enforce policy.  As a result, these registrations represent a piece of state in the network that can change dynamically.  There are many cases where a user agent would like to be notified of changes in this state.  This event package defines a mechanism by which those user agents can request and obtain such notifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Managing, Ordering, Distributing,

Numbers (MODERN): Problem Statement, Use
Cases, and Framework
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8396.html", target="_top", tooltip="The functions of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) are rapidly migrating to the Internet.  This is generating new requirements for many traditional elements of the PSTN, including Telephone Numbers (TNs).  TNs no longer serve simply as telephone routing addresses: they are now identifiers that may be used by Internet-based services for a variety of purposes including session establishment, identity verification, and service enablement.  This problem statement examines how the existing tools for allocating and managing telephone numbers do not align with the use cases of the Internet environment and proposes a framework for Internet-based services relying on TNs."];
