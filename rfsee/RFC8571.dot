North-Bound Distribution of Link-State
and Traffic Engineering (TE) Information
Using BGP
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7752.html", target="_top", tooltip="In a number of environments, a component external to a network is called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and current state of the connections within the network, including Traffic Engineering (TE) information. This is information typically distributed by IGP routing protocols within the network. This document describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE information can be collected from networks and shared with external components using the BGP routing protocol. This is achieved using a new BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding format. The mechanism is applicable to physical and virtual IGP links. The mechanism described is subject to policy control. Applications of this technique include Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) servers and Path Computation Elements (PCEs)."];

A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4271.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol. The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network class within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. This document obsoletes RFC 1771. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Segment Routing Centralized BGP Egress
Peer Engineering
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9087.html", target="_top", tooltip="Segment Routing (SR) leverages source routing. A node steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by prepending the packet with an SR header. A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service based. SR allows for the enforcement of a flow through any topological path while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain. The Segment Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS data plane with no change on the forwarding plane. It requires a minor extension to the existing link-state routing protocols. This document illustrates the application of Segment Routing to solve the BGP Egress Peer Engineering (BGP-EPE) requirement. The SR-based BGP-EPE solution allows a centralized (Software-Defined Networking, or SDN) controller to program any egress peer policy at ingress border routers or at hosts within the domain."];

Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
(ALTO) Performance Cost Metrics
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9439.html", target="_top", tooltip="The cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
Optimization (ALTO), and different applications may use different
types of cost metrics. Since the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285)
defines only a single cost metric (namely, the generic routingcost
metric), if an application wants to issue a cost map or an endpoint
cost request in order to identify a resource provider that offers
better performance metrics (e.g., lower delay or loss rate), the base
protocol does not define the cost metric to be used. This document addresses this issue by extending the specification to
provide a variety of network performance metrics, including network
delay, delay variation (a.k.a. jitter), packet loss rate, hop count,
and bandwidth. There are multiple sources (e.g., estimations based on measurements
or a Service Level Agreement) available for deriving a performance
metric. This document introduces an additional cost-context field
to the ALTO cost-type field to convey the source of a performance
metric."];
