Basic Network Media Services with SIP
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In SIP-based networks, there is a need to provide basic network media services. Such services include network announcements, user interaction, and conferencing services. These services are basic building blocks, from which one can construct interesting applications. In order to have interoperability between servers offering these building blocks (also known as Media Servers) and application developers, one needs to be able to locate and invoke such services in a well defined manner. This document describes a mechanism for providing an interoperable interface between Application Servers, which provide application services to SIP-based networks, and Media Servers, which provide the basic media processing building blocks. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

A Call Control and Multi-Party Usage

To enable discussion of multi-party features and applications, we define an abstract call model for describing the media relationships required by many of these.  The model and actions described here are specifically chosen to be independent of the SIP signaling and/or mixing approach chosen to actually set up the media relationships.  In addition to its dialog manipulation aspect, this framework includes requirements for communicating related information and events such as conference and session state and session history.  This framework also describes other goals that embody the spirit of SIP applications as used on the Internet such as the definition of primitives (not services), invoker and participant oriented primitives, signaling and mixing model independence, and others.

Media Resource Brokering

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is used as the signaling protocol that provides many inherent capabilities for message routing.  In addition to such signaling properties, a need exists for intelligent, application-level media service selection based on non-static signaling properties.  This is especially true when considered in conjunction with deployment architectures that include 1:M and M:N combinations of Application Servers and Media Servers.  This document introduces a Media Resource Broker (MRB) entity, which manages the availability of Media Servers and the media resource demands of Application Servers.

A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Response Code for Rejected Calls
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8688.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the 608 (Rejected) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) response code.  This response code enables calling parties to learn that an intermediary rejected their call attempt.  No one will deliver, and thus answer, the call.  As a 6xx code, the caller will be aware that future attempts to contact the same User Agent Server will likely fail.  The initial use case driving the need for the 608 response code is when the intermediary is an analytics engine.  In this case, the rejection is by a machine or other process.  This contrasts with the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response code in which a human at the target User Agent Server indicates the user did not want the call.  In some jurisdictions, this distinction is important.  This document also defines the use of the Call-Info header field in 608 responses to enable rejected callers to contact entities that blocked their calls in error.  This provides a remediation mechanism for legal callers that find their calls blocked."];
