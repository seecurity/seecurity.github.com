Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
Interoperability with Provider Backbone
Bridges
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The scalability of Hierarchical Virtual Private LAN Service (H-VPLS) with Ethernet access networks (RFC 4762) can be improved by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality in the VPLS access.  Provider Backbone Bridging has been standardized as IEEE 802.1ah-2008.  It aims to improve the scalability of Media Access Control (MAC) addresses and service instances in Provider Ethernet networks.  This document describes different interoperability scenarios where Provider Backbone Bridge functionality is used in H-VPLS with Ethernet or MPLS access network to attain better scalability in terms of number of customer MAC addresses and number of service instances.  The document also describes the scenarios and the mechanisms for incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality within H-VPLS with existing Ethernet access and interoperability among them.  Furthermore, the document discusses the migration mechanisms and scenarios by which Provider Backbone Bridge functionality can be incorporated into H-VPLS with existing MPLS access."];

Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using
Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
Signaling
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4762.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solution using pseudowires, a service previously implemented over other tunneling technologies and known as Transparent LAN Services (TLS). A VPLS creates an emulated LAN segment for a given set of users; i.e., it creates a Layer 2 broadcast domain that is fully capable of learning and forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses and that is closed to a given set of users. Multiple VPLS services can be supported from a single Provider Edge (PE) node. This document describes the control plane functions of signaling pseudowire labels using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), extending RFC 4447. It is agnostic to discovery protocols. The data plane functions of forwarding are also described, focusing in particular on the learning of MAC addresses. The encapsulation of VPLS packets is described by RFC 4448. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
Interoperability with Customer Edge (CE)
Bridges
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6246.html", target="_top", tooltip="One of the main motivations behind Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is its ability to provide connectivity not only among customer routers and servers/hosts but also among customer IEEE bridges. VPLS is expected to deliver the same level of service that current enterprise users are accustomed to from their own enterprise bridged networks or their Ethernet Service Providers. When customer edge (CE) devices are IEEE bridges, then there are certain issues and challenges that need to be accounted for in a VPLS network. The majority of these issues have been addressed in the IEEE 802.1ad standard for provider bridges and they can be leveraged for VPLS networks. This document extends the provider edge (PE) model described in RFC 4664 based on IEEE 802.1ad bridge module, and it illustrates a clear demarcation between the IEEE bridge module and IETF LAN emulation module. By doing so, it shows that the majority of interoperability issues with CE bridges can be delegated to the 802.1ad bridge module, thus removing the burden on the IETF LAN emulation module within a VPLS PE. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Provisioning, Auto-Discovery, and

Once configured, the provisioning information is distributed by a discovery process.  When the discovery process is complete, a signaling protocol is automatically invoked to set up the mesh of pseudowires (PWs) that form the (virtual) backbone of the L2VPN.  This document specifies a number of L2VPN provisioning models, and further specifies the semantic structure of the endpoint identifiers required by each model.  It discusses the distribution of these identifiers by the discovery process, especially when discovery is based on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  It then specifies how the endpoint identifiers are carried in the two signaling protocols that are used to set up PWs, the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), and the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3 (L2TPv3).

It also describes how these security attacks should be detected and reported.  It then discusses possible user requirements for security of a PPVPN service.  These user requirements translate into corresponding provider requirements.  In addition, the provider may have additional requirements to make its network infrastructure secure to a level that can meet the PPVPN customer's expectations.  Finally, this document defines a template that may be used to describe and analyze the security characteristics of a specific PPVPN technology.
