A Null MX No Service Resource Record for
Domains That Accept No Mail
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Internet mail determines the address of a receiving server through the DNS, first by looking for an MX record and then by looking for an A/AAAA record as a fallback.  Unfortunately, this means that the A/AAAA record is taken to be mail server address even when that address does not accept mail.  The No Service MX RR, informally called null MX, formalizes the existing mechanism by which a domain announces that it accepts no mail, without having to provide a mail server; this permits significant operational efficiencies.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

It covers the SMTP extension mechanisms and best practices for the contemporary Internet, but does not provide details about particular extensions.  Although SMTP was designed as a mail transport and delivery protocol, this specification also contains information that is important to its use as a mail submission protocol for split-UA (User Agent) mail reading systems and mobile environments.

Internet Mail Architecture

These changes have been evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve both its installed base and its usefulness.  To collaborate productively on this large and complex system, all participants need to work from a common view of it and use a common language to describe its components and the interactions among them.  But the many differences in perspective currently make it difficult to know exactly what another participant means.  To serve as the necessary common frame of reference, this document describes the enhanced Internet Mail architecture, reflecting the current service.

The 556 code was created to support the new tests and actions specified in RFC 7505.  These codes are used to indicate that an Internet host does not accept incoming mail at all.  This specification is not applicable when the host sometimes accepts mail but may reject particular messages, or even all messages, under specific circumstances."];
