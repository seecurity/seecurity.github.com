In particular, this variant deploys the classic Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol for key establishment featuring perfect forward secrecy in conjunction with a keyed hash message authentication code for achieving mutual authentication and message integrity of the key management messages exchanged.  This protocol addresses the security and performance constraints of multimedia key management in MIKEY. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

MIKEY-RSA-R: An Additional Mode of Key
Distribution in Multimedia Internet
KEYing (MIKEY)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4738.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) specification describes several modes of key distribution solution that address multimedia scenarios (e.g., SIP calls and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) sessions) using pre-shared keys, public keys, and optionally a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  In the public-key mode, the Initiator encrypts a random key with the Responder's public key and sends it to the Responder.  In many communication scenarios, the Initiator may not know the Responder's public key, or in some cases the Responder's ID (e.g., call forwarding) in advance.  We propose a new MIKEY mode that works well in such scenarios.  This mode also enhances the group key management support in MIKEY; it supports member-initiated group key download (in contrast to group manager pushing the group keys to all members).  This document updates RFC 3830 with the RSA-R mode. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

On the Applicability of Various
Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) Modes
and Extensions
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5197.html", target="_top", tooltip="Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) is a key management protocol that can be used for \%real-time applications. In particular, it has been defined focusing on the support of the Secure \%Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). MIKEY itself is standardized within RFC 3830 and defines four key distribution methods. Moreover, it is defined to allow extensions of the protocol. As MIKEY becomes more and more accepted, extensions to the base protocol arise, especially in terms of additional key distribution methods but also in terms of payload enhancements. This document provides an overview about the MIKEY base document in general as well as the existing extensions for MIKEY, which have been defined or are in the process of definition. It is intended as an additional source of information for developers or architects to provide more insight in use case scenarios and motivations as well as advantages and disadvantages for the different key distribution schemes. The use cases discussed in this document are strongly related to dedicated SIP call scenarios providing challenges for key management in general, among them media before Session Description Protocol (SDP) answer, forking, and shared key conferencing.

In this document, we note that the currently defined MIKEY modes are insufficient to address deployment scenarios built around a centralized key management service.  Interest in such deployments is increasing.  Therefore, a set of new MIKEY modes that work well in such scenarios are defined.  The new modes use a trusted key management service and a ticket concept, similar to that in Kerberos.  The new modes also support features used by many existing applications, where the exact identity of the other endpoint may not be known at the start of the communication session.
