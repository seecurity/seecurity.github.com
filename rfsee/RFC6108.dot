Comcast's Web Notification System Design
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The objective of this document is to describe a method of providing critical end-user notifications to web browsers, which has been deployed by Comcast, an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  Such a notification system is being used to provide near-immediate notifications to customers, such as to warn them that their traffic exhibits patterns that are indicative of malware or virus infection.  There are other proprietary systems that can perform such notifications, but those systems utilize Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology.  In contrast to DPI, this document describes a system that does not rely upon DPI, and is instead based in open IETF standards and open source applications.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Internet Content Adaptation Protocol

2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3507.html", target="_top", tooltip="ICAP, the Internet Content Adaption Protocol, is a protocol aimed at providing simple object-based content vectoring for HTTP services.  ICAP is, in essence, a lightweight protocol for executing a remote procedure call on HTTP messages.  It allows ICAP clients to pass HTTP messages to ICAP servers for some sort of transformation or other processing (adaptation).  The server executes its transformation service on messages and sends back responses to the client, usually with modified messages.  Typically, the adapted messages are either HTTP requests or HTTP responses.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):

This specification defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.  The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Such computers can also become inadvertent participants in or components of an online crime network, spam network, and/or phishing network as well as be used as a part of a distributed denial-of-service attack.
