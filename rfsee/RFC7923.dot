Requirements for Subscription to YANG
Datastores
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document provides requirements for a service that allows client applications to subscribe to updates of a YANG datastore.  Based on criteria negotiated as part of a subscription, updates will be pushed to targeted recipients.  Such a capability eliminates the need for periodic polling of YANG datastores by applications and fills a functional gap in existing YANG transports (i.e., Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) and RESTCONF).  Such a service can be summarized as a pub/sub service for YANG datastore updates.  Beyond a set of basic requirements for the service, various refinements are addressed.  These refinements include: periodicity of object updates, filtering out of objects underneath a requested a subtree, and delivery QoS guarantees."];

Security-Related Requirements

The I2RS protocol is implemented by reusing portions of existing IETF protocols and adding new features to them.  One such reuse is of the security features of a secure transport (e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure SHell (SSH) Protocol, Datagram TLS (DTLS)) such as encryption, message integrity, mutual peer authentication, and anti-replay protection.  The new I2RS features to consider from a security perspective are as follows: a priority mechanism to handle multi-headed write transactions, an opaque secondary identifier that identifies an application using the I2RS client, and an extremely constrained read-only non-secure transport."];
