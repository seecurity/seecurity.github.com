It surveys widely deployed IP tunnelling protocols that use such shim headers and updates the specifications of those that do not mention ECN propagation (including RFCs 2661, 3931, 2784, 4380 and 7450, which specify L2TPv2, L2TPv3, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), Teredo, and Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT), respectively).
