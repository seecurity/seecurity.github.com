Content Delivery Network Interconnection
(CDNI) Footprint Types: Country
Subdivision Code and Footprint Union
2023", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN) is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream CDN (dCDN).  RFC 8006 defines footprint types that are used for footprint objects as part of the Metadata interface (MI).  The footprint types are also used for the Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) as defined in RFC 8008.  This document defines two new footprint types.  The first footprint type defined is an ISO 3166-2 country subdivision code.  Defining this country subdivision code improves granularity for delegation as compared to the ISO 3166-1 country code footprint type defined in RFC 8006.  The ISO 3166-2 country subdivision code is also added as a new entity domain type in the ALTO Entity Domain Types registry defined in Section 7.4 of RFC 9241.  The second footprint type defines a footprint union to aggregate footprint objects.  This allows for additive semantics over the narrowing semantics defined in Appendix B of RFC 8008 and therefore updates RFC 8008.  The two new footprint types are based on the requirements raised by Open Caching but are also applicable to CDNI use cases in general.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Content Distribution Network
Interconnection (CDNI) Problem Statement
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6707.html", target="_top", tooltip="Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide numerous benefits for cacheable content: reduced delivery cost, improved quality of experience for End Users, and increased robustness of delivery. For these reasons, they are frequently used for large-scale content delivery. As a result, existing CDN Providers are scaling up their infrastructure, and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying their own CDNs. It is generally desirable that a given content item can be delivered to an End User regardless of that End User's location or attachment network. This is the motivation for interconnecting standalone CDNs so they can interoperate as an open content delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery of content from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to End Users. However, no standards or open specifications currently exist to facilitate such CDN Interconnection. The goal of this document is to outline the problem area of CDN Interconnection for the IETF CDNI (CDN Interconnection) working group. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

An Extension for Application-Layer

Further, these properties are presented as maps, similar to the network and cost maps in the base ALTO Protocol.  While supporting the endpoints and related Endpoint Property Service defined in RFC 7285, the ALTO Protocol is extended in two major directions.  First, from endpoints restricted to IP addresses to entities covering a wider and extensible set of objects; second, from properties for specific endpoints to entire entity property maps.  These extensions introduce additional features that allow entities and property values to be specific to a given information resource.  This is made possible by a generic and flexible design of entity and property types."];
