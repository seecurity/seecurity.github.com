The top of this subordinate branch is defined by a naming convention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with the underscore character (e.g., _name).  The underscored naming construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent domain above the underscored branch.  This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names registry with IANA.  The purpose of this registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the use of the same underscored name for different services."];

DNS Attrleaf Changes: Fixing
Specifications That Use Underscored Node
Names
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8553.html", target="_top", tooltip="Using an underscore for a prefix creates a space for constrained interoperation of resource records.  Original uses of an underscore character as a domain node name prefix were specified without the benefit of an IANA registry.  This produced an entirely uncoordinated set of name-creation activities, all drawing from the same namespace.  A registry for these names has now been defined by RFC 8552.  However, the existing specifications that use underscored naming need to be modified in order to be in line with the new registry.  This document specifies those changes.  The changes preserve existing software and operational practice, while adapting the specifications for those practices to the newer underscore registry model."];

Email Authentication for
Internationalized Mail

In internationalized email, domain names can occur both as U-labels and A-labels.  This specification updates the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC specifications to clarify which form of internationalized domain names to use in those specifications."];

The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC)
Protocol
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8617.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol provides an authenticated chain of custody for a message, allowing each entity that handles the message to see what entities handled it before and what the message's authentication assessment was at each step in the handling. ARC allows Internet Mail Handlers to attach assertions of message authentication assessment to individual messages. As messages traverse ARC-enabled Internet Mail Handlers, additional ARC assertions can be attached to messages to form ordered sets of ARC assertions that represent the authentication assessment at each step of the message-handling paths. ARC-enabled Internet Mail Handlers can process sets of ARC assertions to inform message disposition decisions, identify Internet Mail Handlers that might break existing authentication mechanisms, and convey original authentication assessments across trust boundaries."];

A Format for Self-Published IP
Geolocation Feeds
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8805.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish a mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation information, colloquially termed a geolocation feed. Interested parties can poll and parse these feeds to update or merge with other geolocation data sources and procedures. This format intentionally only allows specifying coarse-level location. Some technical organizations operating networks that move from one conference location to the next have already experimentally published small geolocation feeds. This document describes a currently deployed format. At least one consumer (Google) has incorporated these feeds into a geolocation data pipeline, and a significant number of ISPs are using it to inform them where their prefixes should be geolocated."];
