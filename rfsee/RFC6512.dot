Using Multipoint LDP When the Backbone
Has No Route to the Root
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The control protocol used for constructing Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths (MP LSPs) contains a field that identifies the address of a root node.  Intermediate nodes are expected to be able to look up that address in their routing tables.  However, this is not possible if the route to the root node is a BGP route and the intermediate nodes are part of a BGP-free core.  This document specifies procedures that enable an MP LSP to be constructed through a BGP-free core.  In these procedures, the root node address is temporarily replaced by an address that is known to the intermediate nodes and is on the path to the true root node. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Multicast in Virtual Private LAN Service
(VPLS)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7117.html", target="_top", tooltip="RFCs 4761 and 4762 describe a solution for Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) multicast that relies on the use of point-to-point or multipoint-to-point unicast Label Switched Paths (LSPs) for carrying multicast traffic. This solution has certain limitations for certain VPLS multicast traffic profiles. For example, it may result in highly non-optimal bandwidth utilization when a large amount of multicast traffic is to be transported. This document describes solutions for overcoming a subset of the limitations of the existing VPLS multicast solution. It describes procedures for VPLS multicast that utilize multicast trees in the service provider (SP) network. The solution described in this document allows sharing of one such multicast tree among multiple VPLS instances. Furthermore, the solution described in this document allows a single multicast tree in the SP network to carry traffic belonging only to a specified set of one or more IP multicast streams from one or more VPLS instances."];

Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol
In-Band Signaling in a Virtual Routing
and Forwarding (VRF) Table Context
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7246.html", target="_top", tooltip="An IP Multicast Distribution Tree (MDT) may traverse both label switching (i.e., Multiprotocol Label Switching, or MPLS) and non-label switching regions of a network.  Typically, the MDT begins and ends in non-MPLS regions, but travels through an MPLS region.  In such cases, it can be useful to begin building the MDT as a pure IP MDT, then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path (MP-LSP) when it enters an MPLS-enabled region, and then convert it back to a pure IP MDT when it enters a non-MPLS-enabled region.  Other documents specify the procedures for building such a hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) in the non-MPLS region of the network, and using Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol (mLDP) in the MPLS region.  This document extends those procedures to handle the case where the link connecting the two regions is a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) table link, as defined in the BGP IP/MPLS VPN specification.  However, this document is primarily aimed at particular use cases where VRFs are used to support multicast applications other than multicast VPN."];

Gap Analysis for Operating IPv6-Only
MPLS Networks
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7439.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document reviews the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocol suite in the context of IPv6 and identifies gaps that must be addressed in order to allow MPLS-related protocols and applications to be used with IPv6-only networks. This document is intended to focus on gaps in the standards defining the MPLS suite, and is not intended to highlight particular vendor implementations (or lack thereof) in the context of IPv6-only MPLS functionality. In the data plane, MPLS fully supports IPv6, and MPLS labeled packets can be carried over IPv6 packets in a variety of encapsulations. However, support for IPv6 among MPLS control-plane protocols, MPLS applications, MPLS Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), and MIB modules is mixed, with some protocols having major gaps. For most major gaps, work is in progress to upgrade the relevant protocols."];
