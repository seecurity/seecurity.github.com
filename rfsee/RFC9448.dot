Automatic Certificate Management
Environment (ACME)
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8555.html", target="_top", tooltip="Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) certificates are used for a number of purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of domain names.  Thus, certification authorities (CAs) in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.  As of this writing, this verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms.  This document describes a protocol that a CA and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance.  The protocol also provides facilities for other certificate management functions, such as certificate revocation."];

Secure Telephone Identity Problem
Statement and Requirements
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7340.html", target="_top", tooltip="Over the past decade, Voice over IP (VoIP) systems based on SIP have replaced many traditional telephony deployments.  Interworking VoIP systems with the traditional telephone network has reduced the overall level of calling party number and Caller ID assurances by granting attackers new and inexpensive tools to impersonate or obscure calling party numbers when orchestrating bulk commercial calling schemes, hacking voicemail boxes, or even circumventing multi-factor authentication systems trusted by banks.  Despite previous attempts to provide a secure assurance of the origin of SIP communications, we still lack effective standards for identifying the calling party in a VoIP session.  This document examines the reasons why providing identity for telephone numbers on the Internet has proven so difficult and shows how changes in the last decade may provide us with new strategies for attaching a secure identity to SIP sessions.  It also gives high-level requirements for a solution in this space."];

PASSporT: Personal Assertion Token
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8225.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a method for creating and validating a token that cryptographically verifies an originating identity or, more generally, a URI or telephone number representing the originator of personal communications.  The Personal Assertion Token, PASSporT, is cryptographically signed to protect the integrity of the identity of the originator and to verify the assertion of the identity information at the destination.  The cryptographic signature is defined with the intention that it can confidently verify the originating persona even when the signature is sent to the destination party over an insecure channel.  PASSporT is particularly useful for many personal-communications applications over IP networks and other multi-hop interconnection scenarios where the originating and destination parties may not have a direct trusted relationship."];
