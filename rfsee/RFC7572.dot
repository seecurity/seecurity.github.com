Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Extension for Instant Messaging
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3428.html", target="_top", tooltip="Instant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer of messages between users in near real-time.  These messages are usually, but not required to be, short.  IMs are often used in a conversational mode, that is, the transfer of messages back and forth is fast enough for participants to maintain an interactive conversation.  This document proposes the MESSAGE method, an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that allows the transfer of Instant Messages.  Since the MESSAGE request is an extension to SIP, it inherits all the request routing and security features of that protocol.  MESSAGE requests carry the content in the form of MIME body parts.  MESSAGE requests do not themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal usage each Instant Message stands alone, much like pager messages.  MESSAGE requests may be sent in the context of a dialog initiated by some other SIP request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

An IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646).

The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen instead of extending or changing the definition of URIs. This was done in order to allow a clear distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with existing software. Guidelines are provided for the use and deployment of IRIs in various protocols, formats, and software components that currently deal with URIs."];
