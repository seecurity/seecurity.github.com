Technical Considerations for Internet
Service Blocking and Filtering
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7754.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by certain parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of abusive or objectionable communications.  Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on blocking and filtering, the active prevention of such communications.  This document examines several technical approaches to Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet architecture.  When it is possible to do so, the approach to blocking and filtering that is most coherent with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or objectionable communications.  We observe that certain filtering and blocking approaches can cause unintended consequences to third parties, and we discuss the limits of efficacy of various approaches."];

Reflections on Host Firewalls
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7288.html", target="_top", tooltip="In today's Internet, the need for firewalls is generally accepted in the industry, and indeed firewalls are widely deployed in practice.  Unlike traditional firewalls that protect network links, host firewalls run in end-user systems.  Often the result is that software may be running and potentially consuming resources, but then communication is blocked by a host firewall.  It's taken for granted that this end state is either desirable or the best that can be achieved in practice, rather than (for example) an end state where the relevant software is not running or is running in a way that would not result in unwanted communication.  In this document, we explore the issues behind these assumptions and provide suggestions on improving the architecture going forward."];
