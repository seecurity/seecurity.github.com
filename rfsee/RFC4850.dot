Declarative Public Extension Key for

This document describes a Public Extension Key for the purpose of enhancing iSCSI supportability.  The key accomplishes this objective by allowing iSCSI nodes to communicate architecture details during the iSCSI login sequence.  The receiving node can then use this information for enhanced logging and support.  This document updates RFC 3720 to allow iSCSI extension items to be defined by standards track RFCs and experimental RFCs in addition to informational RFCs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Interface (iSCSI)

The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with the standardized SCSI architecture model.  SCSI is a popular family of protocols that enable systems to communicate with I/O devices, especially storage devices.  SCSI protocols are request/response application protocols with a common standardized architecture model and basic command set, as well as standardized command sets for different device classes (disks, tapes, media-changers etc.).  As system interconnects move from the classical bus structure to a network structure, SCSI has to be mapped to network transport protocols.  IP networks now meet the performance requirements of fast system interconnects and as such are good candidates to carry SCSI. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
