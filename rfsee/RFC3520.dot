Session Authorization Policy Element
2003", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the representation of a session authorization policy element for supporting policy-based per-session authorization and admission control.  The goal of session authorization is to allow the exchange of information between network elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a service and to co-ordinate actions between the signaling and transport planes.  This document describes how a process on a system authorizes the reservation of resources by a host and then provides that host with a session authorization policy element which can be inserted into a resource reservation protocol (e.g., the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) PATH message) to facilitate proper and secure reservation of those resources within the network.  We describe the encoding of session authorization information as a policy element conforming to the format of a Policy Data object (RFC 2750) and provide details relating to operations, processing rules and error scenarios.

This NSLP allows hosts to signal on the data path for NATs and firewalls to be configured according to the needs of the application data flows.  For instance, it enables hosts behind NATs to obtain a publicly reachable address and hosts behind firewalls to receive data traffic.  The overall architecture is given by the framework and requirements defined by the Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) working group.  The network scenarios, the protocol itself, and examples for path-coupled signaling are given in this memo.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for
Quality-of-Service Signaling

It is in accordance with the framework and requirements developed in NSIS.  Together with General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST), it provides functionality similar to RSVP and extends it.  The QoS NSLP is independent of the underlying QoS specification or architecture and provides support for different reservation models.  It is simplified by the elimination of support for multicast flows.  This specification explains the overall protocol approach, describes the design decisions made, and provides examples.  It specifies object, message formats, and processing rules.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Still, the signaling layer protocol above GIST itself may require separate authorization to be performed when a node receives a request for a certain kind of service or resources.  This document presents a generic model and object formats for session authorization within the NSIS signaling layer protocols.  The goal of session authorization is to allow the exchange of information between network elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a service and to coordinate actions between the signaling and transport planes.
