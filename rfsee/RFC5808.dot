Geopriv Requirements

There is a need to securely gather and transfer location information for location services, while at the same time protect the privacy of the individuals involved.  This document focuses on the authorization, security and privacy requirements for such location-dependent services.  Specifically, it describes the requirements for the Geopriv Location Object (LO) and for the protocols that use this Location Object.  This LO is envisioned to be the primary data structure used in all Geopriv protocol exchanges to securely transfer location data.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration

This protocol aims to allow an end host to obtain location information, by value or by reference, from a Location Information Server (LIS) that is located in the access network.  The obtained location information can then be used for a variety of different protocols and purposes.  For example, it can be used as input to the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol or to convey location within the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to other entities.
