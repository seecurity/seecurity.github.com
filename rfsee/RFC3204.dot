Critical Content Multi-purpose Internet
Mail Extensions (MIME) Parameter
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3459.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the use of a mechanism for identifying body parts that a sender deems critical in a multi-part Internet mail message.  The mechanism described is a parameter to Content-Disposition, as described by RFC 3204.  By knowing what parts of a message the sender deems critical, a content gateway can intelligently handle multi-part messages when providing gateway services to systems of lesser capability.  Critical content can help a content gateway to decide what parts to forward.  It can indicate how hard a gateway should try to deliver a body part.  It can help the gateway to pick body parts that are safe to silently delete when a system of lesser capability receives a message.  In addition, critical content can help the gateway chose the notification strategy for the receiving system.  Likewise, if the sender expects the destination to do some processing on a body part, critical content allows the sender to mark body parts that the receiver must process. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
