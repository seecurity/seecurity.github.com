Cryptographically Generated Addresses

Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) are IPv6 addresses for which the interface identifier is generated by computing a cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key and auxiliary parameters.  The binding between the public key and the address can be verified by re-computing the hash value and by comparing the hash with the interface identifier.  Messages sent from an IPv6 address can be protected by attaching the public key and auxiliary parameters and by signing the message with the corresponding private key.  The protection works without a certification authority or any security infrastructure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Significance of IPv6 Interface
Identifiers
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7136.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IPv6 addressing architecture includes a unicast interface identifier that is used in the creation of many IPv6 addresses.  Interface identifiers are formed by a variety of methods.  This document clarifies that the bits in an interface identifier have no meaning and that the entire identifier should be treated as an opaque value.  In particular, RFC 4291 defines a method by which the Universal and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped into an IPv6 unicast interface identifier.  This document clarifies that those two bits are significant only in the process of deriving interface identifiers from an IEEE link-layer address, and it updates RFC 4291 accordingly."];
