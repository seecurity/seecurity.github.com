A Practice for Revoking Posting Rights
to IETF Mailing Lists
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3683.html", target="_top", tooltip="All self-governing bodies have ways of managing the scope of participant interaction.  The IETF uses a consensus-driven process for developing computer-communications standards in an open fashion.  An important part of this consensus-driven process is the pervasive use of mailing lists for discussion.  Notably, in a small number of cases, a participant has engaged in a denial-of-service attack to disrupt the consensus-driven process.  Regrettably, as these bad faith attacks become more common, the IETF needs to establish a practice that reduces or eliminates these attacks.  This memo recommends such a practice for use by the IETF.
