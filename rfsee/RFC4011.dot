Stringprep Revision and Problem
Statement for the Preparation and

(PRECIS)
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6885.html", target="_top", tooltip="If a protocol expects to compare two strings and is prepared only for those strings to be ASCII, then using Unicode code points in those strings requires they be prepared somehow.  Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (here called IDNA2003) defined and used Stringprep and Nameprep.  Other protocols subsequently defined Stringprep profiles.  A new approach different from Stringprep and Nameprep is used for a revision of IDNA2003 (called IDNA2008).  Other Stringprep profiles need to be similarly updated, or a replacement of Stringprep needs to be designed.  This document outlines the issues to be faced by those designing a Stringprep replacement."];
