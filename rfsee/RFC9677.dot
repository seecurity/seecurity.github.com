Delegated Credentials for TLS and DTLS
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9345.html", target="_top", tooltip="The organizational separation between operators of TLS and DTLS endpoints and the certification authority can create limitations.  For example, the lifetime of certificates, how they may be used, and the algorithms they support are ultimately determined by the Certification Authority (CA).  This document describes a mechanism to overcome some of these limitations by enabling operators to delegate their own credentials for use in TLS and DTLS without breaking compatibility with peers that do not support this specification."];

Framework for Content Distribution
Network Interconnection (CDNI)

The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the relationships among the various components necessary to interconnect CDNs.  CDNI requires the specification of interfaces and mechanisms to address issues such as request routing, distribution metadata exchange, and logging information exchange across CDNs.  The intent of this document is to outline what each interface needs to accomplish and to describe how these interfaces and mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed specification to other documents.  This document, in combination with RFC 6707, obsoletes RFC 3466."];

Content Distribution Network
Interconnection (CDNI) Requirements
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7337.html", target="_top", tooltip="Content delivery is frequently provided by specifically architected and provisioned Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). As a result of significant growth in content delivered over IP networks, existing CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure. Many Network Service Providers (NSPs) and Enterprise Service Providers (ESPs) are also deploying their own CDNs. To deliver contents from the Content Service Provider (CSP) to end users, the contents may traverse across multiple CDNs. This creates a need for interconnecting (previously) standalone CDNs so that they can collectively act as a single delivery platform from the CSP to the end users. The goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for the solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working group."];
