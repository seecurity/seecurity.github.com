Deterministic Networking Architecture
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8655.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency within a network domain.  Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the network topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in spite of the loss of a path.  DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time- Sensitive Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1."];

Packet Ordering Function
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9550.html", target="_top", tooltip="The replication and elimination functions of the Deterministic Networking (DetNet) architecture can result in out-of-order packets, which is not acceptable for some time-sensitive applications.  The Packet Ordering Function (POF) algorithms described in this document enable restoration of the correct packet order when the replication and elimination functions are used in DetNet networks.  The POF only provides ordering within the latency bound of a DetNet flow; it does not provide any additional reliability."];
