Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) Schema

This model defines two hierarchies of object classes: structural classes representing information for representing and controlling policy data as specified in RFC 3060, and relationship classes that indicate how instances of the structural classes are related to each other.  Classes are also added to the LDAP schema to improve the performance of a client's interactions with an LDAP server when the client is retrieving large amounts of policy-related information.  These classes exist only to optimize LDAP retrievals: there are no classes in the information model that correspond to them. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
