The China Mobile, Huawei, and ZTE
Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) Simple
Control and User Plane Separation
Protocol (S-CUSP)
2020", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="A Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) in a fixed wireline access network is an Ethernet-centric IP edge router and the aggregation point for subscriber traffic. Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS) for such a BNG improves flexibility and scalability but requires various communication between the User Plane (UP) and the Control Plane (CP). China Mobile, Huawei Technologies, and ZTE have developed a simple CUPS control channel protocol to support such communication: the Simple Control and User Plane Separation Protocol (S-CUSP). S-CUSP is defined in this document. This document is not an IETF standard and does not have IETF consensus. S-CUSP is presented here to make its specification conveniently available to the Internet community to enable diagnosis and interoperability.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Routing Backus-Naur Form (RBNF): A
Syntax Used to Form Encoding Rules in
Various Routing Protocol Specifications
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5511.html", target="_top", tooltip="Several protocols have been specified in the Routing Area of the IETF using a common variant of the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) of representing message syntax. However, there is no formal definition of this version of BNF. There is value in using the same variant of BNF for the set of protocols that are commonly used together. This reduces confusion and simplifies implementation. Updating existing documents to use some other variant of BNF that is already formally documented would be a substantial piece of work. This document provides a formal definition of the variant of BNF that has been used (that we call Routing BNF) and makes it available for use by new protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
