It provides an incrementally deployable approach for scalability, provider independence, mobility, multihoming, traffic engineering, and security.  This document describes a series of use cases in order to showcase the architectural capabilities.  It further shows how the RANGER architecture restores the network-within-network principles originally intended for the sustained growth of the Internet.

Evolution of the IP Model
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6250.html", target="_top", tooltip="This RFC attempts to document various aspects of the IP service model and how it has evolved over time.  In particular, it attempts to document the properties of the IP layer as they are seen by upper- layer protocols and applications, especially properties that were (and, at times, still are) incorrectly perceived to exist as well as properties that would cause problems if changed.  The discussion of these properties is organized around evaluating a set of claims, or misconceptions.  Finally, this document provides some guidance to protocol designers and implementers.
