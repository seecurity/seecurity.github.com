A Firmware Update Architecture for

Incorporating such an update mechanism is a fundamental requirement for fixing vulnerabilities, but it also enables other important capabilities such as updating configuration settings and adding new functionality. In addition to the definition of terminology and an architecture, this document provides the motivation for the standardization of a manifest format as a transport-agnostic means for describing and protecting firmware updates.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Given a type of service that a client is looking for, and a domain in which the client is looking for that service, this mechanism allows clients to discover a list of named instances of that desired service, using standard DNS queries.  This mechanism is referred to as DNS-based Service Discovery, or DNS-SD."];

Trust Anchor Management Requirements
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6024.html", target="_top", tooltip="A trust anchor represents an authoritative entity via a public key and associated data.  The public key is used to verify digital signatures, and the associated data is used to constrain the types of information for which the trust anchor is authoritative.  A relying party uses trust anchors to determine if a digitally signed object is valid by verifying a digital signature using the trust anchor's public key, and by enforcing the constraints expressed in the associated data for the trust anchor.  This document describes some of the problems associated with the lack of a standard trust anchor management mechanism and defines requirements for data formats and push-based protocols designed to address these problems.
