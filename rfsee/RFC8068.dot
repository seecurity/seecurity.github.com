A Framework for Conferencing with the

These sessions are managed by SIP dialogs, which represent a SIP relationship between a pair of user agents.  Because dialogs are between pairs of user agents, SIP's usage for two-party communications (such as a phone call), is obvious.  Communications sessions with multiple participants, generally known as conferencing, are more complicated.  This document defines a framework for how such conferencing can occur.

The Session Recording Protocol specifies the use of SIP, SDP, and RTP to establish a Recording Session (RS) between the Session Recording Client (SRC), which is on the path of the CS, and a Session Recording Server (SRS) at the recording device.  This document considers only active recording, where the SRC purposefully streams media to an SRS and all participating user agents (UAs) are notified of the recording.  Passive recording, where a recording device detects media directly from the network (e.g., using port-mirroring techniques), is outside the scope of this document.
