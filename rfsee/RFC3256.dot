DHCP Relay Agent Information Option
2001", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3046.html", target="_top", tooltip="Newer high-speed public Internet access technologies call for a high- speed modem to have a local area network (LAN) attachment to one or more customer premise hosts.  It is advantageous to use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) as defined in RFC 2131 to assign customer premise host IP addresses in this environment.  However, a number of security and scaling problems arise with such public DHCP use.  This document describes a new DHCP option to address these issues.  This option extends the set of DHCP options as defined in RFC 2132. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Address Resolution Mechanisms for IP
Datagrams over MPEG-2 Networks
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4947.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the process of binding/associating IPv4/IPv6 addresses with MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). This procedure is known as Address Resolution (AR) or Neighbor Discovery (ND). Such address resolution complements the higher-layer resource discovery tools that are used to advertise IP sessions. In MPEG-2 Networks, an IP address must be associated with a Packet ID (PID) value and a specific Transmission Multiplex. This document reviews current methods appropriate to a range of technologies (such as DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting), ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee), DOCSIS (Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications), and variants). It also describes the interaction with well-known protocols for address management including DHCP, ARP, and the ND protocol. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
