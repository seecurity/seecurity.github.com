Softwire Mesh Framework
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5565.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet needs to be able to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  However, it is expected that some constituent networks of the Internet will be single-protocol networks.  One kind of single-protocol network can parse only IPv4 packets and can process only IPv4 routing information; another kind can parse only IPv6 packets and can process only IPv6 routing information.  It is nevertheless required that either kind of single-protocol network be able to provide transit service for the other protocol.  This is done by passing the other kind of routing information from one edge of the single-protocol network to the other, and by tunneling the other kind of data packet from one edge to the other.  The tunnels are known as softwires.  This framework document explains how the routing information and the data packets of one protocol are passed through a single-protocol network of the other protocol.  The document is careful to specify when this can be done with existing technology and when it requires the development of new or modified technology. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the Framework over time.  The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.

The BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address

Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5512.html", target="_top", tooltip="In certain situations, transporting a packet from one Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) speaker to another (the BGP next hop) requires that the packet be encapsulated by the first BGP speaker and decapsulated by the second. To support these situations, there needs to be some agreement between the two BGP speakers with regard to the encapsulation information, i.e., the format of the encapsulation header as well as the contents of various fields of the header. The encapsulation information need not be signaled for all encapsulation types. In cases where signaling is required (such as Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) with key), this document specifies a method by which BGP speakers can signal encapsulation information to each other. The signaling is done by sending BGP updates using the Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) and the IPv4 or IPv6 Address Family Identifier (AFI). In cases where no encapsulation information needs to be signaled (such as GRE without key), this document specifies a BGP extended community that can be attached to BGP UPDATE messages that carry payload prefixes in order to indicate the encapsulation protocol type to be used.

Some of the IETF-defined tunneling techniques are not listed in the current IANA registry.
