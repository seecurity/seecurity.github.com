DHCP Options for Service Location

Mesh-enhanced Service Location Protocol
(mSLP)
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3528.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the Mesh-enhanced Service Location Protocol (mSLP).  mSLP enhances the Service Location Protocol (SLP) with a scope-based fully-meshed peering Directory Agent (DA) architecture.  Peer DAs exchange new service registrations in shared scopes via anti- entropy and direct forwarding.  mSLP improves the reliability and consistency of SLP DA services, and simplifies Service Agent (SA) registrations in systems with multiple DAs.  mSLP is backward compatible with SLPv2 and can be deployed incrementally.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

An Overview of the IETF Network
Management Standards
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6632.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document gives an overview of the IETF network management standards and summarizes existing and ongoing development of IETF Standards Track network management protocols and data models.  The document refers to other overview documents, where they exist and classifies the standards for easy orientation.  The purpose of this document is, on the one hand, to help system developers and users to select appropriate standard management protocols and data models to address relevant management needs.  On the other hand, the document can be used as an overview and guideline by other Standard Development Organizations or bodies planning to use IETF management technologies and data models.  This document does not cover Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) technologies on the data-path, e.g., OAM of tunnels, MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) OAM, and pseudowire as well as the corresponding management models.
