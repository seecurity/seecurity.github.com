Post-Delivery Message Downgrading for
Internationalized Email Messages

Upgraded POP and IMAP servers support internationalized messages.

To avoid that situation, this document describes a mechanism for converting internationalized messages into the traditional message format.  As part of the conversion process, message elements that require internationalized treatment are recoded or removed, and receivers are able to recognize that they received messages containing such elements, even if they cannot process the internationalized elements.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
