IS-IS Flood Reflection
2023", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a backward-compatible, optional IS-IS extension that allows the creation of IS-IS flood reflection topologies.  Flood reflection permits topologies in which IS-IS Level 1 (L1) areas provide transit-forwarding for IS-IS Level 2 (L2) areas using all available L1 nodes internally.  It accomplishes this by creating L2 flood reflection adjacencies within each L1 area.  Those adjacencies are used to flood L2 Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) and are used in the L2 Shortest Path First (SPF) computation.  However, they are not ordinarily utilized for forwarding within the flood reflection cluster.  This arrangement gives the L2 topology significantly better scaling properties than prevalently used flat designs.  As an additional benefit, only those routers directly participating in flood reflection are required to support the feature.  This allows for incremental deployment of scalable L1 transit areas in an existing, previously flat network design, without the necessity of upgrading all routers in the network."];

A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4271.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol. The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network class within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. This document obsoletes RFC 1771. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution with

The IS-IS protocol is specified in ISO 10589, with extensions for supporting IPv4 (Internet Protocol) specified in RFC 1195. This document replaces RFC 2966. This document extends the semantics presented in RFC 1195 so that a routing domain running with both level 1 and level 2 Intermediate Systems (IS) (routers) can distribute IP prefixes between level 1 and level 2, and vice versa. This distribution requires certain restrictions to ensure that persistent forwarding loops do not form. The goal of this domain-wide prefix distribution is to increase the granularity of the routing information within the domain. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

BGP Optimal Route Reflection (BGP ORR)
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9107.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines an extension to BGP route reflectors. On route reflectors, BGP route selection is modified in order to choose the best route from the standpoint of their clients, rather than from the standpoint of the route reflectors themselves. Depending on the scaling and precision requirements, route selection can be specific for one client, common for a set of clients, or common for all clients of a route reflector. This solution is particularly applicable in deployments using centralized route reflectors, where choosing the best route based on the route reflector's IGP location is suboptimal. This facilitates, for example, a best exit point policy (hot potato routing). The solution relies upon all route reflectors learning all paths that are eligible for consideration. BGP route selection is performed in the route reflectors based on the IGP cost from configured locations in the link-state IGP."];
