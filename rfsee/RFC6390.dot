RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time

RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.

The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.

Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
(ALTO) Performance Cost Metrics
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9439.html", target="_top", tooltip="The cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
Optimization (ALTO), and different applications may use different
types of cost metrics. Since the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285)
defines only a single cost metric (namely, the generic routingcost
metric), if an application wants to issue a cost map or an endpoint
cost request in order to identify a resource provider that offers
better performance metrics (e.g., lower delay or loss rate), the base
protocol does not define the cost metric to be used. This document addresses this issue by extending the specification to
provide a variety of network performance metrics, including network
delay, delay variation (a.k.a. jitter), packet loss rate, hop count,
and bandwidth. There are multiple sources (e.g., estimations based on measurements
or a Service Level Agreement) available for deriving a performance
metric. This document introduces an additional cost-context field
to the ALTO cost-type field to convey the source of a performance
metric."];
