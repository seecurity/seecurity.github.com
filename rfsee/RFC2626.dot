The Internet and the Millennium Problem
(Year 2000)
1999", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Year 2000 Working Group (WG) has conducted an investigation into the millennium problem as it regards Internet related protocols.  This investigation only targeted the protocols as documented in the Request For Comments Series (RFCs).  This investigation discovered little reason for concern with regards to the functionality of the protocols.  A few minor cases of older implementations still using two digit years (ala RFC 850) were discovered, but almost all Internet protocols were given a clean bill of health.  Several cases of period problems were discovered, where a time field would roll over as the size of field was reached.  In particular, there are several protocols, which have 32 bit, signed integer representations of the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 which will turn negative at Tue Jan 19 03:14:07 GMT 2038.  Areas whose protocols will be effected by such problems have been notified so that new revisions will remove this limitation.

Unique Addresses are Good

The Quantum Bug

This will lead to a perceived round-trip time of zero seconds on some Internet paths, a capability which was not predicted and so not included as a possibility in many protocol specifications.  Worse than the millennium bug, this unexpected value is bound to cause serious Internet failures unless the specifications are fixed in time."];
