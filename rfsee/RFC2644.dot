Evolution of the IP Model

The discussion of these properties is organized around evaluating a set of claims, or misconceptions.  Finally, this document provides some guidance to protocol designers and implementers.

Simplified Multicast Forwarding
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6621.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) mechanism that provides basic Internet Protocol (IP) multicast forwarding suitable for limited wireless mesh and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) use.  It is mainly applicable in situations where efficient flooding represents an acceptable engineering design trade-off.  It defines techniques for multicast duplicate packet detection (DPD), to be applied in the forwarding process, for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol use.  This document also specifies optional mechanisms for using reduced relay sets to achieve more efficient multicast data distribution within a mesh topology as compared to Classic Flooding.  Interactions with other protocols, such as use of information provided by concurrently running unicast routing protocols or interaction with other multicast protocols, as well as multiple deployment approaches are also described.  Distributed algorithms for selecting reduced relay sets and related discussion are provided in the appendices.  Basic issues relating to the operation of multicast MANET border routers are discussed, but ongoing work remains in this area and is beyond the scope of this document.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Privacy Considerations for Protocols
Relying on IP Broadcast or Multicast
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8386.html", target="_top", tooltip="A number of application-layer protocols make use of IP broadcast or multicast messages for functions such as local service discovery or name resolution.  Some of these functions can only be implemented efficiently using such mechanisms.  When using broadcast or multicast messages, a passive observer in the same broadcast or multicast domain can trivially record these messages and analyze their content.  Therefore, designers of protocols that make use of broadcast or multicast messages need to take special care when designing their protocols."];
