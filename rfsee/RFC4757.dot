The RC4-HMAC Kerberos Encryption Types
Used by Microsoft Windows

This is offered as an alternative to using the existing DES-based encryption types. The RC4-HMAC encryption types are used to ease upgrade of existing Windows NT environments, provide strong cryptography (128-bit key lengths), and provide exportable (meet United States government export restriction requirements) encryption. This document describes the implementation of those encryption types.
