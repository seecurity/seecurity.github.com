The Network Access Identifier

This document defines the syntax for the Network Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity submitted by the client during network authentication. Roaming may be loosely defined as the ability to use any one of multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs), while maintaining a formal, \%customer-vendor relationship with only one.  Examples of where roaming capabilities might be required include ISP confederations and \%ISP-provided corporate network access support.  This document is a revised version of RFC 2486, which originally defined NAIs.
