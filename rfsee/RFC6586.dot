An FTP Application Layer Gateway (ALG)
for IPv6-to-IPv4 Translation
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6384.html", target="_top", tooltip="The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) has a very long history, and despite the fact that today other options exist to perform file transfers, FTP is still in common use. As such, in situations where some client computers only have IPv6 connectivity while many servers are still IPv4-only and IPv6-to-IPv4 translators are used to bridge that gap, it is important that FTP is made to work through these translators to the best possible extent. FTP has an active and a passive mode, both as original commands that are IPv4-specific and as extended, IP version agnostic commands. The only FTP mode that works without changes through an IPv6-to-IPv4 translator is extended passive. However, many existing FTP servers do not support this mode, and some clients do not ask for it.

Default Address Selection for Internet
Protocol version 6 (IPv6)
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3484.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes two algorithms, for source address selection and for destination address selection.  The algorithms specify default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations.  They do not override choices made by applications or upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the development of more advanced mechanisms for address selection.  The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior.  In dual stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses - depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice-versa.  All IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers, must implement default address selection as defined in this specification. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
