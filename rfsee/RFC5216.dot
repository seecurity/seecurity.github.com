The three quantities, system strength, symmetric key strength, and public key strength, must be consistently matched for any network protocol usage.

2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9427.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Extensible Authentication Protocol-TLS (EAP-TLS) (RFC 5216) has been updated for TLS 1.3 in RFC 9190.  Many other EAP Types also depend on TLS, such as EAP-Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) (RFC 4851), EAP-Tunneled TLS (EAP-TTLS) (RFC 5281), the Tunnel Extensible Authentication Protocol (TEAP) (RFC 7170).  It is possible that many vendor-specific EAP methods, such as the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP), depend on TLS as well.  This document updates those methods in order to use the new key derivation methods available in TLS 1.3.  Additional changes necessitated by TLS 1.3 are also discussed."];

Forward Secrecy Extension to the
Improved Extensible Authentication
Protocol Method for Authentication and
Key Agreement (EAP-AKA' FS)
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9678.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document updates RFC 9048, Improved Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for 3GPP Mobile Network Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA'), and its predecessor RFC 5448 with an optional extension providing ephemeral key exchange.  The extension EAP-AKA' Forward Secrecy (EAP-AKA' FS), when negotiated, provides forward secrecy for the session keys generated as a part of the authentication run in EAP-AKA'.  This prevents an attacker who has gained access to the long-term key from obtaining session keys established in the past.  In addition, EAP-AKA' FS mitigates passive attacks (e.g., large-scale pervasive monitoring) against future sessions.  This forces attackers to use active attacks instead."];
