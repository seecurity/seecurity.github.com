Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base
Protocol Specification
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6325.html", target="_top", tooltip="Routing Bridges (RBridges) provide optimal pair-wise forwarding without configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. They achieve these goals using IS-IS routing and encapsulation of traffic with a header that includes a hop count. RBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are as invisible to current IP routers as bridges are and, like routers, they terminate the bridge spanning tree protocol. The design supports VLANs and the optimization of the distribution of multi-destination frames based on VLAN ID and based on IP-derived multicast groups. It also allows unicast forwarding tables at transit RBridges to be sized according to the number of RBridges (rather than the number of end nodes), which allows their forwarding tables to be substantially smaller than in conventional customer bridges.

Transparent Interconnection of Lots of
Links (TRILL): Problem and Applicability
Statement
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5556.html", target="_top", tooltip="Current IEEE 802.1 LANs use spanning tree protocols that have a number of challenges.  These protocols need to strictly avoid loops, even temporary ones, during route propagation, because of the lack of header loop detection support.  Routing tends not to take full advantage of alternate paths, or even non-overlapping pairwise paths (in the case of spanning trees).  This document addresses these concerns and suggests applying modern network-layer routing protocols at the link layer.  This document assumes that solutions would not address issues of scalability beyond that of existing IEEE 802.1 bridged links, but that a solution would be backward compatible with 802.1, including hubs, bridges, and their existing plug-and-play capabilities.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the Framework over time.  The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.  The document also recommends that RFCs 1157, 1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic status.  This document obsoletes RFC 2570.
