OSPF Out-of-Band Link State Database
(LSDB) Resynchronization
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4811.html", target="_top", tooltip="OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks. Link State Database (LSDB) synchronization in OSPF is achieved via two methods -- initial LSDB synchronization when an OSPF router has just been connected to the network and asynchronous flooding that ensures continuous LSDB synchronization in the presence of topology changes after the initial procedure was completed. It may sometime be necessary for OSPF routers to resynchronize their LSDBs. The OSPF standard, however, does not allow routers to do so without actually changing the topology view of the network. This memo describes a vendor-specific mechanism to perform such a form of out-of-band LSDB synchronization. The mechanism described in this document was proposed before Graceful OSPF Restart, as described in RFC 3623, came into existence. It is implemented/supported by at least one major vendor and is currently deployed in the field. The purpose of this document is to capture the details of this mechanism for public use.

OSPF Restart Signaling

Routers find new and detect unreachable neighbors via the Hello subprotocol. Hello OSPF packets are also used to ensure two-way connectivity within time. When a router restarts its OSPF software, it may not know its neighbors. If such a router sends a Hello packet on an interface, its neighbors are going to reset the adjacency, which may not be desirable in certain conditions. This memo describes a vendor-specific mechanism that allows OSPF routers to inform their neighbors about the restart process. Note that this mechanism requires support from neighboring routers.

Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Extension
of OSPF Using Connected Dominating Set
(CDS) Flooding
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5614.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies an extension of OSPFv3 to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).  The extension, called OSPF-MDR, is designed as a new OSPF interface type for MANETs.  OSPF-MDR is based on the selection of a subset of MANET routers, consisting of MANET Designated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs.  The MDRs form a connected dominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs together form a biconnected CDS for robustness.  This CDS is exploited in two ways.  First, to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedure is used in which only (Backup) MDRs flood new link state advertisements (LSAs) back out the receiving interface; reliable flooding is ensured by retransmitting LSAs along adjacencies.  Second, adjacencies are formed only between (Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors, allowing for much better scaling in dense networks.  The CDS is constructed using 2-hop neighbor information provided in a Hello protocol extension.  The Hello protocol is further optimized by allowing differential Hellos that report only changes in neighbor states.  Options are specified for originating router-LSAs that provide full or partial topology information, allowing overhead to be reduced by advertising less topology information.
