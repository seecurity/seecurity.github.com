Unsolicited Bidirectional Forwarding
Detection (BFD) for Sessionless
Applications
2023", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="For operational simplification of sessionless applications using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), in this document, we present procedures for unsolicited BFD that allow a BFD session to be initiated by only one side and established without explicit per-session configuration or registration by the other side (subject to certain per-interface or global policies). We also introduce a new YANG module to configure and manage unsolicited BFD. The YANG module in this document is based on YANG 1.1, as defined in RFC 7950, and conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA), as described in RFC 8342.

A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4271.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol. The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network class within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. This document obsoletes RFC 1771. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
