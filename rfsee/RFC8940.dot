The derivation of Session-Id for full authentication is clarified for both EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA.  The derivation of Session-Id for Protected EAP (PEAP) is also given.

Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP.  EAP provides its own support for duplicate elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees.  Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual EAP methods may support this.  This document obsoletes RFC 2284.
