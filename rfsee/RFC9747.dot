Unaffiliated Bidirectional Forwarding
Detection (BFD) Echo
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies an extension to the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol that enables the use of the BFD Echo function without the need for an associated BFD control session. This Unaffiliated BFD Echo mechanism allows rapid detection of forwarding path failures in networks where establishing BFD control sessions is impractical or undesirable. By decoupling the Echo function from the control plane, network devices can utilize BFD's fast failure detection capabilities in a simplified manner, enhancing network resiliency and operational efficiency. This document updates RFC 5880 by defining a new Unaffiliated BFD Echo mechanism."];

Ingress Filtering for Multihomed

2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3704.html", target="_top", tooltip="BCP 38, RFC 2827, is designed to limit the impact of distributed denial of service attacks, by denying traffic with spoofed addresses access to the network, and to help ensure that traffic is traceable to its correct source network.  As a side effect of protecting the Internet against such attacks, the network implementing the solution also protects itself from this and other attacks, such as spoofed management access to networking equipment.  There are cases when this may create problems, e.g., with multihoming.  This document describes the current ingress filtering operational mechanisms, examines generic issues related to ingress filtering, and delves into the effects on multihoming in particular.
