The Internet Routing Overlay Network
(IRON)
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Since the Internet must continue to support escalating growth due to increasing demand, it is clear that current routing architectures and operational practices must be updated.  This document proposes an Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) that supports sustainable growth while requiring no changes to end systems and no changes to the existing routing system.  IRON further addresses other important issues including routing scaling, mobility management, multihoming, traffic engineering and NAT traversal.  While business considerations are an important determining factor for widespread adoption, they are out of scope for this document.  This document is a product of the IRTF Routing Research Group.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Routing and Addressing in Networks with
Global Enterprise Recursion (RANGER)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5720.html", target="_top", tooltip="RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing in networks with global enterprise recursion.  The term enterprise network within this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and deployment scenarios, where an enterprise can be as small as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) network, as dynamic as a Mobile Ad Hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational corporation, or as large as the global Internet itself.  Such networks will require an architected solution for the coordination of routing and addressing plans with accommodations for scalability, provider-independence, mobility, multihoming, and security.  These considerations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the same principles apply even for clean-slate approaches.  The RANGER architecture addresses these requirements and provides a comprehensive framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence.

A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4271.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol. The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network class within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. This document obsoletes RFC 1771. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
