Marker PDU Aligned Framing for TCP
Specification
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5044.html", target="_top", tooltip="Marker PDU Aligned Framing (MPA) is designed to work as an adaptation layer between TCP and the Direct Data Placement protocol (DDP) as described in RFC 5041.  It preserves the reliable, in-order delivery of TCP, while adding the preservation of higher-level protocol record boundaries that DDP requires.  MPA is fully compliant with applicable TCP RFCs and can be utilized with existing TCP implementations.  MPA also supports integrated implementations that combine TCP, MPA and DDP to reduce buffering requirements in the implementation and improve performance at the system level. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The document reviews various attacks against the resources defined in the architectural model and the countermeasures that can be used to protect the system.  Attacks are grouped into those that can be mitigated by using secure communication channels across the network, attacks from Remote Peers, and attacks from Local Peers.  Attack categories include spoofing, tampering, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA. This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
