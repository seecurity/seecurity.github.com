Report from the IAB Workshop on
Environmental Impact of Internet
Applications and Systems, 2022
2024", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Internet communications and applications have both environmental costs and benefits. The IAB ran an online workshop in December 2022 to explore and understand these impacts. The role of the workshop was to discuss the impacts and the evolving industry needs, and to identify areas for improvements and future work. A key goal of the workshop was to call further attention to the topic and bring together a diverse stakeholder community to discuss these issues. Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Terminology for Benchmarking Network-
layer Traffic Control Mechanisms
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4689.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes terminology for the benchmarking of devices that implement traffic control using packet classification based on defined criteria.  The terminology is to be applied to measurements made on the data plane to evaluate IP traffic control mechanisms.  Rules for packet classification can be based on any field in the IP header, such as the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), or any field in the packet payload, such as port number.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

A Framework for Defining Network
Complexity
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7980.html", target="_top", tooltip="Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet there is no generally accepted definition of the term. Complexity metrics exist in a wide range of research papers, but most of these address only a particular aspect of a network, for example, the complexity of a graph or software. While it may be impossible to define a metric for overall network complexity, there is a desire to better understand the complexity of a network as a whole, as deployed today to provide Internet services. This document provides a framework to guide research on the topic of network complexity as well as some practical examples for trade-offs in networking. This document summarizes the work of the IRTF's Network Complexity Research Group (NCRG) at the time of its closure. It does not present final results, but a snapshot of an ongoing activity, as a basis for future work."];

Concise Binary Object Representation

These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack. This document obsoletes RFC 7049, providing editorial improvements, new details, and errata fixes while keeping full compatibility with the interchange format of RFC 7049.
