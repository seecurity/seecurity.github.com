Referred-By Mechanism

This document extends the REFER method, allowing the referrer to provide information about the REFER request to the refer target using the referee as an intermediary.  This information includes the identity of the referrer and the URI to which the referrer referred.  The mechanism utilizes S/MIME to help protect this information from a malicious intermediary.
