Aggregation of Diffserv Service Classes
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In the core of a high-capacity network, service differentiation may still be needed to support applications' utilization of the network.  Applications with similar traffic characteristics and performance requirements are mapped into Diffserv service classes based on end- to-end behavior requirements of the applications.  However, some network segments may be configured in such a way that a single forwarding treatment may satisfy the traffic characteristics and performance requirements of two or more service classes.  In these cases, it may be desirable to aggregate two or more Diffserv service classes into a single forwarding treatment.  This document provides guidelines for the aggregation of Diffserv service classes into forwarding treatments.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Metering and Marking Behaviour of PCN-
Nodes
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5670.html", target="_top", tooltip="The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain in a simple, scalable, and robust fashion.  This document defines the two metering and marking behaviours of PCN-nodes.  Threshold-metering and -marking marks all PCN-packets if the rate of PCN-traffic is greater than a configured rate (PCN-threshold-rate).  Excess- traffic-metering and -marking marks a proportion of PCN-packets, such that the amount marked equals the rate of PCN-traffic in excess of a configured rate (PCN-excess-rate).  The level of marking allows PCN-boundary-nodes to make decisions about whether to admit or terminate PCN-flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Baseline Encoding and Transport of Pre-
Congestion Information
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5696.html", target="_top", tooltip="The objective of the Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) architecture is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain.  It achieves this by marking packets belonging to PCN-flows when the rate of traffic exceeds certain configured thresholds on links in the domain.  These marks can then be evaluated to determine how close the domain is to being congested.  This document specifies how such marks are encoded into the IP header by redefining the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints within such domains.  The baseline encoding described here provides only two PCN encoding states: Not-marked and PCN-marked.  Future extensions to this encoding may be needed in order to provide more than one level of marking severity. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A Differentiated Services Code Point

This traffic is also admitted by the network using a Call Admission Control (CAC) procedure involving authentication, authorization, and capacity admission.

Encoding Three Pre-Congestion
Notification (PCN) States in the IP
Header Using a Single Diffserv Codepoint
(DSCP)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6660.html", target="_top", tooltip="The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain. The overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the PCN- domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded. Egress nodes pass information about these PCN-marks to Decision Points that then decide whether to admit or block new flow requests or to terminate some already admitted flows during serious pre-congestion. This document specifies how PCN-marks are to be encoded into the IP header by reusing the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints within a PCN-domain. The PCN wire protocol for non-IP protocol headers will need to be defined elsewhere. Nonetheless, this document clarifies the PCN encoding for MPLS in an informational appendix. The encoding for IP provides for up to three different PCN marking states using a single Diffserv codepoint (DSCP): not-marked (NM), threshold-marked (ThM), and excess-traffic-marked (ETM). Hence, it is called the 3-in-1 PCN encoding. This document obsoletes RFC 5696. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Differentiated Services (Diffserv) and
Real-Time Communication
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7657.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (Diffserv) network quality-of-service (QoS) functionality and real- time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  Diffserv is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different Diffserv Codepoints (DSCPs).  WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS requirements using the same network 5-tuple.  The results of using multiple DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple have transport protocol interactions, particularly with congestion control functionality (e.g., reordering).  In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination.  This memo covers the implications of these Diffserv aspects for real-time network communication, including WebRTC."];

Many network providers operate Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) using Treatment Aggregates for traffic marked with different Diffserv Per-Hop Behaviors and use MPLS for interconnection with other networks.  This document offers a simple interconnection approach that may simplify operation of Diffserv for network interconnection among providers that use MPLS and apply the Short Pipe Model.  While motivated by the requirements of MPLS network operators that use Short Pipe Model tunnels, this document is applicable to other networks, both MPLS and non-MPLS."];
