The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Referred-By Mechanism
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER method provides a mechanism where one party (the referrer) gives a second party (the referee) an arbitrary URI to reference.  If that URI is a SIP URI, the referee will send a SIP request, often an INVITE, to that URI (the refer target).  This document extends the REFER method, allowing the referrer to provide information about the REFER request to the refer target using the referee as an intermediary.  This information includes the identity of the referrer and the URI to which the referrer referred.  The mechanism utilizes S/MIME to help protect this information from a malicious intermediary.  This protection is optional, but a recipient may refuse to accept a request unless it is present. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Interoperability Profile for Relay User

2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9248.html", target="_top", tooltip="Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by which a hearing person can communicate with a sign language speaker who is deaf, deafblind, or hard of hearing (HoH) or has a speech disability using an interpreter (i.e., a Communications Assistant (CA)) connected via a videophone to the sign language speaker and an audio telephone call to the hearing user.  The CA interprets using sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.  Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency, termed a provider in this document.  The provider also provides a video service that allows users to connect video devices to their service and subsequently to CAs and other sign language speakers.  It is desirable that the videophones used by the sign language speaker conform to a standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that direct video calls between sign language speakers work.  This document describes the interface between a videophone and a provider."];
