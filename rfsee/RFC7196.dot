Making Route Flap Damping Usable
2014", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed to reduce BGP churn in routers.  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for being well connected because topological richness amplifies the number of update messages exchanged.  Many operators have turned RFD off.  Based on experimental measurement, this document recommends adjusting a few RFD algorithmic constants and limits in order to reduce the high risks with RFD.  The result is damping a non-trivial amount of long-term churn without penalizing well-behaved prefixes' normal convergence process.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

BGP Route Flap Damping

A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4271.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol. The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network class within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. This document obsoletes RFC 1771. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Multicast VPN State Damping

Use of BGP for Routing in Large-Scale
Data Centers

In this document, such data centers are referred to as large-scale to differentiate them from smaller infrastructures.  Environments of this scale have a unique set of network requirements with an emphasis on operational simplicity and network stability.  This document summarizes operational experience in designing and operating large-scale data centers using BGP as the only routing protocol.  The intent is to report on a proven and stable routing design that could be leveraged by others in the industry."];
