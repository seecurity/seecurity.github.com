Identity Selection Hints for the
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is defined in RFC 3748. This document defines a mechanism that allows an access network to provide identity selection hints to an EAP peer -- the end of the link that responds to the authenticator. The purpose is to assist the EAP peer in selecting an appropriate Network Access Identifier (NAI). This is useful in situations where the peer does not receive a lower-layer indication of what network it is connecting to, or when there is no direct roaming relationship between the access network and the peer's home network. In the latter case, authentication is typically accomplished via a mediating network such as a roaming consortium or broker. The mechanism defined in this document is limited in its scalability. It is intended for access networks that have a small to moderate number of direct roaming partners.

Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP.  EAP provides its own support for duplicate elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees.  Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual EAP methods may support this.  This document obsoletes RFC 2284.

The Network Access Identifier

Roaming may be loosely defined as the ability to use any one of multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs), while maintaining a formal, \%customer-vendor relationship with only one.  Examples of where roaming capabilities might be required include ISP confederations and \%ISP-provided corporate network access support.  This document is a revised version of RFC 2486, which originally defined NAIs.  Enhancements include international character set and privacy support, as well as a number of corrections to the original RFC. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

RFC 4187 (EAP-AKA) made the use of this mechanism possible within the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework. RFC 5448 (EAP-AKA') was an improved version of EAP-AKA. This document is the most recent specification of EAP-AKA', including, for instance, details about and references related to operating EAP-AKA' in 5G networks.

The key derivation function has been defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). EAP-AKA' allows its use in EAP in an interoperable manner. EAP-AKA' also updates the algorithm used in hash functions, as it employs SHA-256 / HMAC-SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 / HMAC-SHA-1, which is used in EAP-AKA. This version of the EAP-AKA' specification defines the protocol behavior for both 4G and 5G deployments, whereas the previous version defined protocol behavior for 4G deployments only.
