Voice Profile for Internet Mail -
version 2 (VPIMv2)
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies a restricted profile of the Internet multimedia messaging protocols for use between voice processing server platforms.  The profile is referred to as the Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) in this document.  These platforms have historically been special-purpose computers and often do not have the same facilities normally associated with a traditional Internet Email-capable computer.  As a result, VPIM also specifies additional functionality, as it is needed.  This profile is intended to specify the minimum common set of features to allow interworking between conforming systems.  This document obsoletes RFC 2421 and describes version 2 of the profile with greater precision.  No protocol changes were made in this revision.  A list of changes from RFC 2421 are noted in Appendix F.  Appendix A summarizes the protocol profiles of this version of VPIM. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Internet Mail Architecture
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5598.html", target="_top", tooltip="Over its thirty-five-year history, Internet Mail has changed significantly in scale and complexity, as it has become a global infrastructure service.  These changes have been evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve both its installed base and its usefulness.  To collaborate productively on this large and complex system, all participants need to work from a common view of it and use a common language to describe its components and the interactions among them.  But the many differences in perspective currently make it difficult to know exactly what another participant means.  To serve as the necessary common frame of reference, this document describes the enhanced Internet Mail architecture, reflecting the current service.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Message Disposition Notification
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8098.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo defines a MIME content type that may be used by a Mail User Agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a message after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient. This content type is intended to be machine processable. Additional message header fields are also defined to permit Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender of a message. The purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary LAN-based systems, and are often referred to as read receipts, acknowledgements, or receipt notifications. The intention is to do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past. Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary LAN-based systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a multiprotocol messaging environment. To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of foreign addresses, in addition to those normally used in Internet Mail. Additional attributes may also be defined to support tunneling of foreign notifications through Internet Mail. This document is an Internet Standard. It obsoletes RFC 3798 and updates RFC 2046 (message/partial media type handling) and RFC 3461 (Original-Recipient header field generation requirement)."];
