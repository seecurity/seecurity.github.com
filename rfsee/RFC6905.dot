Looking at the acronym a bit more closely reveals a set of recurring problems that are revisited time and again.

There are other definitions and acronyms that will be discussed while exploring the definition of the constituent parts of the OAM term. This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice."];

Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base
Protocol Specification
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6325.html", target="_top", tooltip="Routing Bridges (RBridges) provide optimal pair-wise forwarding without configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. They achieve these goals using IS-IS routing and encapsulation of traffic with a header that includes a hop count. RBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are as invisible to current IP routers as bridges are and, like routers, they terminate the bridge spanning tree protocol. The design supports VLANs and the optimization of the distribution of multi-destination frames based on VLAN ID and based on IP-derived multicast groups. It also allows unicast forwarding tables at transit RBridges to be sized according to the number of RBridges (rather than the number of end nodes), which allows their forwarding tables to be substantially smaller than in conventional customer bridges.
