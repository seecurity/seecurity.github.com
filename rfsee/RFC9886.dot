DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) in the Domain
Name System
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines the Domain Name System (DNS) functionality of a Drone Remote Identification Protocol (DRIP) Identity Management Entity (DIME).  It is built around DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) to standardize a hierarchical registry structure and associated processes to facilitate trustable and scalable registration and lookup of information related to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  The registry system supports issuance, discovery, and verification of DETs, enabling secure identification and association of UAS and their operators.  It also defines the interactions between different classes of registries (root, organizational, and individual) and their respective roles in maintaining the integrity of the registration data.  This architecture enables decentralized, federated operation while supporting privacy, traceability, and regulatory compliance requirements in the context of UAS Remote Identification and other services.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA

To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.
