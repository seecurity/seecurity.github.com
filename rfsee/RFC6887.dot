Use of the extension causes nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface identifiers that change over time, even in cases where the interface contains an embedded IEEE identifier.

Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult.

Deterministic Address Mapping to Reduce
Logging in Carrier-Grade NAT Deployments
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7422.html", target="_top", tooltip="In some instances, Service Providers (SPs) have a legal logging requirement to be able to map a subscriber's inside address with the address used on the public Internet (e.g., for abuse response).  Unfortunately, many logging solutions for Carrier-Grade NATs (CGNs) require active logging of dynamic translations.  CGN port assignments are often per connection, but they could optionally use port ranges.  Research indicates that per-connection logging is not scalable in many residential broadband services.  This document suggests a way to manage CGN translations in such a way as to significantly reduce the amount of logging required while providing traceability for abuse response.  IPv6 is, of course, the preferred solution.  While deployment is in progress, SPs are forced by business imperatives to maintain support for IPv4.  This note addresses the IPv4 part of the network when a CGN solution is in use."];

Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic.
