Perhaps the most common use of IPsec is in providing virtual private networking capabilities.  One very popular use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) is to provide telecommuter access to the corporate Intranet.  Today, NATs are widely deployed in home gateways, as well as in other locations likely to be used by telecommuters, such as hotels.  The result is that IPsec-NAT incompatibilities have become a major barrier in the deployment of IPsec in one of its principal uses.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

This document is a snapshot of IPsec- and IKE-related RFCs. It includes a brief description of each RFC, along with background information explaining the motivation and context of IPsec's outgrowths and extensions. It obsoletes RFC 2411, the previous IP Security Document Roadmap. The obsoleted IPsec roadmap (RFC 2411) briefly described the interrelationship of the various classes of base IPsec documents. The major focus of RFC 2411 was to specify the recommended contents of documents specifying additional encryption and authentication algorithms.
