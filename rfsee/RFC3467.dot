Role of the Domain Name System (DNS)

A framework for an alternative to placing these additional stresses on the DNS is then outlined.  This document and that framework are not a proposed solution, only a strong suggestion that the time has come to begin thinking more broadly about the problems we are encountering and possible approaches to solving them.

National and Local Characters for DNS
Top Level Domain (TLD) Names

This document reviews some of the motivations for such domains, several suggestions that have been made to provide needed functionality, and the constraints that the DNS imposes.  It then suggests an alternative, local translation, that may solve a superset of the problem while avoiding protocol changes, serious deployment delays, and other difficulties.  The suggestion utilizes a localization technique in applications to permit any TLD to be accessed using the vocabulary and characters of any language.
