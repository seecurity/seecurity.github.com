Transparent Interconnection of Lots of
Links (TRILL): Address Flush Message
2018", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol, by default, learns end station addresses from observing the data plane. In particular, it learns local Media Access Control (MAC) addresses and the edge switch port of attachment from the receipt of local data frames and learns remote MAC addresses and the edge switch port of attachment from the decapsulation of remotely sourced TRILL Data packets. This document specifies a message by which a TRILL switch can explicitly request other TRILL switches to flush certain MAC reachability learned through the decapsulation of TRILL Data packets. This is a supplement to the TRILL automatic address forgetting (see Section 4.8.3 of RFC 6325) and can assist in achieving more rapid convergence in case of topology or configuration change.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base
Protocol Specification
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6325.html", target="_top", tooltip="Routing Bridges (RBridges) provide optimal pair-wise forwarding without configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. They achieve these goals using IS-IS routing and encapsulation of traffic with a header that includes a hop count. RBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are as invisible to current IP routers as bridges are and, like routers, they terminate the bridge spanning tree protocol. The design supports VLANs and the optimization of the distribution of multi-destination frames based on VLAN ID and based on IP-derived multicast groups. It also allows unicast forwarding tables at transit RBridges to be sized according to the number of RBridges (rather than the number of end nodes), which allows their forwarding tables to be substantially smaller than in conventional customer bridges.

RFC 7177, RFC 7357, and an intended replacement of RFC 6439 provide clarifications and updates with respect to adjacency, the TRILL ESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information) protocol, and Appointed Forwarders, respectively.  This document provides other known clarifications, corrections, and updates.

Transparent Interconnection of Lots of
Links (TRILL): Fine-Grained Labeling
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7172.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IETF has standardized Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL), a protocol for least-cost transparent frame routing in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and link technologies, using link-state routing and a hop count.  The TRILL base protocol standard supports the labeling of TRILL Data packets with up to 4K IDs.  However, there are applications that require a larger number of labels providing configurable isolation of data.  This document updates RFC 6325 by specifying optional extensions to the TRILL base protocol to safely accomplish this.  These extensions, called fine-grained labeling, are primarily intended for use in large data centers, that is, those with more than 4K users requiring configurable data isolation from each other."];

Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using
Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
Signaling
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4762.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solution using pseudowires, a service previously implemented over other tunneling technologies and known as Transparent LAN Services (TLS). A VPLS creates an emulated LAN segment for a given set of users; i.e., it creates a Layer 2 broadcast domain that is fully capable of learning and forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses and that is closed to a given set of users. Multiple VPLS services can be supported from a single Provider Edge (PE) node. This document describes the control plane functions of signaling pseudowire labels using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), extending RFC 4447. It is agnostic to discovery protocols. The data plane functions of forwarding are also described, focusing in particular on the learning of MAC addresses. The encapsulation of VPLS packets is described by RFC 4448. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA

To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.
