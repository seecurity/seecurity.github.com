Split Network Virtualization Edge
(Split-NVE) Control-Plane Requirements
2018", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In the Split Network Virtualization Edge (Split-NVE) architecture, the functions of the NVE are split across a server and a piece of external network equipment that is called an External NVE. The server-resident control-plane functionality resides in control software, which may be part of hypervisor or container-management software; for simplicity, this document refers to the hypervisor as the location of this software. One or more control-plane protocols between a hypervisor and its associated External NVE(s) are used by the hypervisor to distribute its virtual-machine networking state to the External NVE(s) for further handling. This document illustrates the functionality required by this type of control-plane signaling protocol and outlines the high-level requirements. Virtual-machine states as well as state transitioning are summarized to help clarify the protocol requirements.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Problem Statement: Overlays for Network
Virtualization
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7364.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes issues associated with providing multi-tenancy in large data center networks and how these issues may be addressed using an overlay-based network virtualization approach.  A key multi-tenancy requirement is traffic isolation so that one tenant's traffic is not visible to any other tenant.  Another requirement is address space isolation so that different tenants can use the same address space within different virtual networks.  Traffic and address space isolation is achieved by assigning one or more virtual networks to each tenant, where traffic within a virtual network can only cross into another virtual network in a controlled fashion (e.g., via a configured router and/or a security gateway).  Additional functionality is required to provision virtual networks, associating a virtual machine's network interface(s) with the appropriate virtual network and maintaining that association as the virtual machine is activated, migrated, and/or deactivated.  Use of an overlay-based approach enables scalable deployment on large network infrastructures."];

The architecture is given at a high level, showing the major components of an overall system.  An important goal is to divide the space into individual smaller components that can be implemented independently with clear inter-component interfaces and interactions.  It should be possible to build and implement individual components in isolation and have them interoperate with other independently implemented components.  That way, implementers have flexibility in implementing individual components and can optimize and innovate within their respective components without requiring changes to other components."];

Network Virtualization over Layer 3
(NVO3) Encapsulation Considerations
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9638.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IETF Network Virtualization Overlays (NVO3) Working Group developed considerations for a common encapsulation that addresses various network virtualization overlay technical concerns. This document provides a record, for the benefit of the IETF community, of the considerations arrived at by the NVO3 Working Group starting from the output of the NVO3 encapsulation Design Team. These considerations may be helpful with future deliberations by working groups over the choice of encapsulation formats. There are implications of having different encapsulations in real environments consisting of both software and hardware implementations and within and spanning multiple data centers. For example, Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions such as path MTU discovery become challenging with multiple encapsulations along the data path. Based on these considerations, the NVO3 Working Group determined that Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve) with a few modifications is the common encapsulation. This document provides more details, particularly in Section 7."];
