Multipoint LDP In-Band Signaling for
Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-
Multipoint Label Switched Paths
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6826.html", target="_top", tooltip="Consider an IP multicast tree, constructed by Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM), that needs to pass through an MPLS domain in which Multipoint LDP (mLDP) point-to-multipoint and/or multipoint-to-multipoint Labels Switched Paths (LSPs) can be created.  The part of the IP multicast tree that traverses the MPLS domain can be instantiated as a multipoint LSP.  When a PIM Join message is received at the border of the MPLS domain, information from that message is encoded into mLDP messages.  When the mLDP messages reach the border of the next IP domain, the encoded information is used to generate PIM messages that can be sent through the IP domain.  The result is an IP multicast tree consisting of a set of IP multicast sub-trees that are spliced together with a multipoint LSP.  This document describes procedures regarding how IP multicast trees are spliced together with multipoint LSPs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Label Distribution Protocol Extensions
for Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-
to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6388.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) for the setup of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in MPLS networks.  These extensions are also referred to as multipoint LDP.  Multipoint LDP constructs the P2MP or MP2MP LSPs without interacting with or relying upon any other multicast tree construction protocol.  Protocol elements and procedures for this solution are described for building such LSPs in a receiver-initiated manner.  There can be various applications for multipoint LSPs, for example IP multicast or support for multicast in BGP/MPLS Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs).  Specification of how such applications can use an LDP signaled multipoint LSP is outside the scope of this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Multipoint LDP (mLDP) In-Band Signaling
with Wildcards
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7438.html", target="_top", tooltip="There are scenarios in which an IP multicast tree traverses an MPLS domain.  In these scenarios, it can be desirable to convert the IP multicast tree seamlessly into an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path (MP-LSP) when it enters the MPLS domain, and then to convert it back to an IP multicast tree when it exits the MPLS domain.  Previous documents specify procedures that allow certain kinds of IP multicast trees (either Source-Specific Multicast trees or Bidirectional Multicast trees) to be attached to an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path (MP-LSP).  However, the previous documents do not specify procedures for attaching IP Any-Source Multicast trees to MP-LSPs, nor do they specify procedures for aggregating multiple IP multicast trees onto a single MP-LSP.  This document specifies the procedures to support these functions.  It does so by defining wildcard encodings that make it possible to specify, when setting up an MP- LSP, that a set of IP multicast trees, or a shared IP multicast tree, should be attached to that MP-LSP.  Support for non-bidirectional IP Any-Source Multicast trees is subject to certain applicability restrictions that are discussed in this document.  This document updates RFCs 6826 and 7246."];
