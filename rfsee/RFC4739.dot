Multiple Authentication Exchanges in the
Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) protocol supports several mechanisms for authenticating the parties, including signatures with public-key certificates, shared secrets, and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods.  Currently, each endpoint uses only one of these mechanisms to authenticate itself.  This document specifies an extension to IKEv2 that allows the use of multiple authentication exchanges, using either different mechanisms or the same mechanism.  This extension allows, for instance, performing certificate-based authentication of the client host followed by an EAP authentication of the user.  When backend authentication servers are used, they can belong to different administrative domains, such as the network access provider and the service provider.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2
(IKEv2) Session Resumption
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5723.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certain computational and communication overhead with respect to the number of round trips required and the cryptographic operations involved. In remote access situations, the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used for authentication, which adds several more round trips and consequently latency. To re-establish security associations (SAs) upon a failure recovery condition is time consuming especially when an IPsec peer (such as a VPN gateway) needs to re-establish a large number of SAs with various endpoints. A high number of concurrent sessions might cause additional problems for an IPsec peer during SA re-establishment. In order to avoid the need to re-run the key exchange protocol from scratch, it would be useful to provide an efficient way to resume an IKE/IPsec session. This document proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly efficient manner, utilizing a previously established IKE SA. A client can reconnect to a gateway from which it was disconnected. The proposed approach encodes partial IKE state into an opaque ticket, which can be stored on the client or in a centralized store, and is later made available to the IKEv2 responder for re-authentication. We use the term ticket to refer to the opaque data that is created by the IKEv2 responder. This document does not specify the format of the ticket but examples are provided. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

IP Security (IPsec) and Internet Key
Exchange (IKE) Document Roadmap
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6071.html", target="_top", tooltip="Over the past few years, the number of RFCs that define and use IPsec and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) has greatly proliferated. This is complicated by the fact that these RFCs originate from numerous IETF working groups: the original IPsec WG, its various spin-offs, and other WGs that use IPsec and/or IKE to protect their protocols' traffic. This document is a snapshot of IPsec- and IKE-related RFCs. It includes a brief description of each RFC, along with background information explaining the motivation and context of IPsec's outgrowths and extensions. It obsoletes RFC 2411, the previous IP Security Document Roadmap. The obsoleted IPsec roadmap (RFC 2411) briefly described the interrelationship of the various classes of base IPsec documents. The major focus of RFC 2411 was to specify the recommended contents of documents specifying additional encryption and authentication algorithms. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
