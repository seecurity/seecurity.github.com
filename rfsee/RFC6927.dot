Variants in Second-Level Names
Registered in Top-Level Domains
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) provides a method to map a subset of names written in Unicode into the DNS.  Because of Unicode decisions, appearance, language and writing system conventions, and historical reasons, it often has been asserted that there is more than one way to write what competent readers and writers think of as the same host name; these different ways of writing are often called variants. (The authors note that there are many conflicting definitions for the term variant in the IDNA community.) This document surveys the approaches that top-level domains have taken to the registration and provisioning of domain names that have variants.  This document is not a product of the IETF, does not propose any method to make variants work correctly, and is not an introduction to internationalization or IDNA.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Joint Engineering Team (JET) Guidelines
for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)
Registration and Administration for
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3743.html", target="_top", tooltip="Achieving internationalized access to domain names raises many complex issues.  These are associated not only with basic protocol design, such as how names are represented on the network, compared, and converted to appropriate forms, but also with issues and options for deployment, transition, registration, and administration.  The IETF Standards for Internationalized Domain Names, known as IDNA, focuses on access to domain names in a range of scripts that is broader in scope than the original ASCII.  The development process made it clear that use of characters with similar appearances and/or interpretations created potential for confusion, as well as difficulties in deployment and transition.  The conclusion was that, while those issues were important, they could best be addressed administratively rather than through restrictions embedded in the protocols.  This document defines a set of guidelines for applying restrictions of that type for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) scripts and the zones that use them and, perhaps, the beginning of a framework for thinking about other zones, languages, and scripts.
