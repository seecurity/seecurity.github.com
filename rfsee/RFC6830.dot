Alternative Logical Topology (LISP+ALT)

The MR can then query that ETR to obtain the actual mapping information, which consists of a list of Routing Locators (RLOCs) for the EID.  Termed the Alternative Logical Topology (ALT), the index is built as an overlay network on the public Internet using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE).

IPv6 and UDP Checksums for Tunneled
Packets
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6935.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document updates the IPv6 specification (RFC 2460) to improve performance when a tunnel protocol uses UDP with IPv6 to tunnel packets.  The performance improvement is obtained by relaxing the IPv6 UDP checksum requirement for tunnel protocols whose header information is protected on the inner packet being carried.  Relaxing this requirement removes the overhead associated with the computation of UDP checksums on IPv6 packets that carry the tunnel protocol packets.  This specification describes how the IPv6 UDP checksum requirement can be relaxed when the encapsulated packet itself contains a checksum.  It also describes the limitations and risks of this approach and discusses the restrictions on the use of this method."];

Problem Statement: Overlays for Network
Virtualization
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7364.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes issues associated with providing multi-tenancy in large data center networks and how these issues may be addressed using an overlay-based network virtualization approach.  A key multi-tenancy requirement is traffic isolation so that one tenant's traffic is not visible to any other tenant.  Another requirement is address space isolation so that different tenants can use the same address space within different virtual networks.  Traffic and address space isolation is achieved by assigning one or more virtual networks to each tenant, where traffic within a virtual network can only cross into another virtual network in a controlled fashion (e.g., via a configured router and/or a security gateway).  Additional functionality is required to provision virtual networks, associating a virtual machine's network interface(s) with the appropriate virtual network and maintaining that association as the virtual machine is activated, migrated, and/or deactivated.  Use of an overlay-based approach enables scalable deployment on large network infrastructures."];

LISP-capable routers exchange encapsulated packets according to EID-to-RLOC mappings stored in a local Map-Cache.

By using this control plane service interface and communicating with Map-Resolvers and Map-Servers, LISP Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs) and Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) are not dependent on the details of mapping database systems; this behavior facilitates modularity with different database designs. Since these devices implement the edge of the LISP control plane infrastructure, connecting EID addressable nodes of a LISP site, the implementation and operational complexity of the overall cost and effort of deploying LISP is reduced.
