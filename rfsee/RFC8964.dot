IANA Registry and Processing
Recommendations for the First Nibble
Following a Label Stack
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9790.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document creates a new IANA registry (called the Post-Stack First Nibble registry) for the first nibble (4-bit field) immediately following an MPLS label stack. Furthermore, this document presents some requirements for registering new values and making the processing of MPLS packets easier and more robust. The relationship between the IANA Post-Stack First Nibble registry and the IP Version Numbers registry (RFC 2780) is described in this document. This document updates RFC 4928 by deprecating the heuristic method for identifying the type of packet encapsulated in MPLS."];

Use Cases for MPLS Network Action
Indicators and Ancillary Data
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9791.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents use cases that have a common feature that may be addressed by encoding network action indicators and associated ancillary data within MPLS packets. There is community interest in extending the MPLS data plane to carry such indicators and ancillary data to address these use cases. The use cases described in this document are not an exhaustive set but rather the ones that have been actively discussed by members of the IETF MPLS, PALS, and DetNet Working Groups from the beginning of work on MPLS Network Action (MNA) until the publication of this document."];
