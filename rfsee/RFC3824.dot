Using E.164 numbers with the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="There are a number of contexts in which telephone numbers are employed by Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) applications, many of which can be addressed by ENUM.  Although SIP was one of the primary applications for which ENUM was created, there is nevertheless a need to define procedures for integrating ENUM with SIP implementations.  This document illustrates how the two protocols might work in concert, and clarifies the authoring and processing of ENUM records for SIP applications.  It also provides guidelines for instances in which ENUM, for whatever reason, cannot be used to resolve a telephone number.

ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for
Unicast Secure RTP
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6189.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines ZRTP, a protocol for media path Diffie-Hellman exchange to agree on a session key and parameters for establishing unicast Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) sessions for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.  The ZRTP protocol is media path keying because it is multiplexed on the same port as RTP and does not require support in the signaling protocol.  ZRTP does not assume a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or require the complexity of certificates in end devices.  For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication.  ZRTP can utilize a Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication through the signaling channel.  To provide best effort SRTP, ZRTP utilizes normal RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) profiles.  ZRTP secures media sessions that include a voice media stream and can also secure media sessions that do not include voice by using an optional digital signature.
