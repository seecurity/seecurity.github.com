The 128-Bit Blockcipher CLEFIA
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the specification of the blockcipher CLEFIA.  CLEFIA is a 128-bit blockcipher, with key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits, which is compatible with the interface of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  The algorithm of CLEFIA was published in 2007, and its security has been scrutinized in the public community.  CLEFIA is one of the new-generation lightweight blockcipher algorithms designed after AES.  Among them, CLEFIA offers high performance in software and hardware as well as lightweight implementation in hardware.  CLEFIA will be of benefit to the Internet, which will be connected to more distributed and constrained devices.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
