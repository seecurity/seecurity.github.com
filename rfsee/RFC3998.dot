The Subscription Object specifies that when one of the specified Events occurs, the Printer delivers an asynchronous Event Notification to the specified Notification Recipient via the specified Push or Pull Delivery Method (i.e., protocol). A client associates Subscription Objects with a particular Job by performing the Create-Job-Subscriptions operation or by submitting a Job with subscription information. A client associates Subscription Objects with the Printer by performing a Create-Printer-Subscriptions operation. Four other operations are defined for Subscription Objects: Get-Subscriptions-Attributes, Get-Subscriptions, Renew-Subscription, and Cancel-Subscription. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

This document describes a simplified model consisting of abstract objects, attributes, and operations that is independent of encoding and transport. The model consists of several objects, including Printers and Jobs. Jobs optionally support multiple Documents. IPP semantics allow End Users and Operators to query Printer capabilities; submit Print Jobs; inquire about the status of Print Jobs and Printers; and cancel, hold, and release Print Jobs. IPP semantics also allow Operators to pause and resume Jobs and Printers. Security, internationalization, and directory issues are also addressed by the model and semantics.
