Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS):
Framework
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) working group is considering protocols for signaling information about a data flow along its path in the network. The NSIS suite of protocols is envisioned to support various signaling applications that need to install and/or manipulate such state in the network. Based on existing work on signaling requirements, this document proposes an architectural framework for these signaling protocols. This document provides a model for the network entities that take part in such signaling, and for the relationship between signaling and the rest of network operation. We decompose the overall signaling protocol suite into a generic (lower) layer, with separate upper layers for each specific signaling application.

NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for
Quality-of-Service Signaling

It is in accordance with the framework and requirements developed in NSIS.  Together with General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST), it provides functionality similar to RSVP and extends it.  The QoS NSLP is independent of the underlying QoS specification or architecture and provides support for different reservation models.  It is simplified by the elimination of support for multicast flows.  This specification explains the overall protocol approach, describes the design decisions made, and provides examples.  It specifies object, message formats, and processing rules.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

NSIS Operation over IP Tunnels
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5979.html", target="_top", tooltip="NSIS Quality of Service (QoS) signaling enables applications to perform QoS reservation along a data flow path.  When the data flow path contains IP tunnel segments, NSIS QoS signaling has no effect within those tunnel segments.  Therefore, the resulting tunnel segments could become the weakest QoS link and invalidate the QoS efforts in the rest of the end-to-end path.  The problem with NSIS signaling within the tunnel is caused by the tunnel encapsulation that masks packets' original IP header fields.  Those original IP header fields are needed to intercept NSIS signaling messages and classify QoS data packets.  This document defines a solution to this problem by mapping end-to-end QoS session requests to corresponding QoS sessions in the tunnel, thus extending the end-to-end QoS signaling into the IP tunnel segments.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Authorization for NSIS Signaling Layer
Protocols

Still, the signaling layer protocol above GIST itself may require separate authorization to be performed when a node receives a request for a certain kind of service or resources.  This document presents a generic model and object formats for session authorization within the NSIS signaling layer protocols.  The goal of session authorization is to allow the exchange of information between network elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a service and to coordinate actions between the signaling and transport planes.
