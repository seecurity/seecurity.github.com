As currently specified, the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) does not have the ability to signal the MTU for a Label Switched Path (LSP) to the ingress Label Switching Router (LSR).  In the absence of this functionality, the MTU for each LSP must be statically configured by network operators or by equivalent off-line mechanisms.  This document specifies experimental extensions to LDP in support of LSP MTU discovery.
