Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP)
Version 1.0
2003", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes an application programming interface and a corresponding protocol (MGCP) which is used between elements of a decomposed multimedia gateway.  The decomposed multimedia gateway consists of a Call Agent, which contains the call control intelligence, and a media gateway which contains the media functions, e.g., conversion from TDM voice to Voice over IP.  Media gateways contain endpoints on which the Call Agent can create, modify and delete connections in order to establish and control media sessions with other multimedia endpoints.  Also, the Call Agent can instruct the endpoints to detect certain events and generate signals.  The endpoints automatically communicate changes in service state to the Call Agent.  Furthermore, the Call Agent can audit endpoints as well as the connections on endpoints.  The basic and general MGCP protocol is defined in this document, however most media gateways will need to implement one or more MGCP packages, which define extensions to the protocol suitable for use with specific types of media gateways.  Such packages are defined in separate documents.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Return Code Usage

Return codes in RFC 3435 do not cover all possible specific situations that may ever occur in a gateway.  That is not possible and not necessary.  What is important is to ensure that the Call Agent that receives a return code behaves appropriately and consistently for the given situation.  The purpose of this document is to provide implementation guidelines to ensure that consistency."];

IAX: Inter-Asterisk eXchange Version 2
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5456.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes IAX, the Inter-Asterisk eXchange protocol, an application-layer control and media protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. IAX was developed by the open source community for the Asterisk Private Branch Exchange (PBX) and is targeted primarily at Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call control, but it can be used with streaming video or any other type of multimedia. IAX is an all in one protocol for handling multimedia in IP networks. It combines both control and media services in the same protocol. In addition, IAX uses a single UDP data stream on a static port greatly simplifying Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway traversal, eliminating the need for other protocols to work around NAT, and simplifying network and firewall management. IAX employs a compact encoding that decreases bandwidth usage and is well suited for Internet telephony service. In addition, its open nature permits new payload type additions needed to support additional services.

Latching: Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT) for

HNT is a set of mechanisms, such as media relaying and latching, that such intermediaries use to enable other RTC devices behind NATs to communicate with each other. This document is non-normative and is only written to explain HNT in order to provide a reference to the Internet community and an informative description to manufacturers and users. Latching, which is one of the HNT components, has a number of security issues covered here. Because of those, and unless all security considerations explained here are taken into account and solved, the IETF advises against use of the latching mechanism over the Internet and recommends other solutions, such as the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol."];
