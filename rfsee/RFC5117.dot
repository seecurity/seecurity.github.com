RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time
Applications
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3550.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

Extended RTP Profile for Real-time
Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based
Feedback (RTP/AVPF)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4585.html", target="_top", tooltip="Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree, resilient against packet losses.  Receivers may use the base mechanisms of the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to report packet reception statistics and thus allow a sender to adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term.  This is the sole means for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few codec-specific mechanisms).  This document defines an extension to the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables receivers to provide, statistically, more immediate feedback to the senders and thus allows for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based repair mechanisms to be implemented.  This early feedback profile (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth constraints for RTCP and preserves scalability to large groups. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Rapid Synchronisation of RTP Flows
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6051.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo outlines how RTP sessions are synchronised, and discusses how rapidly such synchronisation can occur. We show that most RTP sessions can be synchronised immediately, but that the use of video switching multipoint conference units (MCUs) or large source-specific multicast (SSM) groups can greatly increase the synchronisation delay. This increase in delay can be unacceptable to some applications that use layered and/or multi-description codecs. This memo introduces three mechanisms to reduce the synchronisation delay for such sessions. First, it updates the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) timing rules to reduce the initial synchronisation delay for SSM sessions. Second, a new feedback packet is defined for use with the extended RTP profile for RTCP-based feedback (RTP/AVPF), allowing video switching MCUs to rapidly request resynchronisation. Finally, new RTP header extensions are defined to allow rapid synchronisation of late joiners, and guarantee correct timestamp-based decoding order recovery for layered codecs in the presence of clock skew.

ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for
Unicast Secure RTP

The ZRTP protocol is media path keying because it is multiplexed on the same port as RTP and does not require support in the signaling protocol.  ZRTP does not assume a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or require the complexity of certificates in end devices.  For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication.  ZRTP can utilize a Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication through the signaling channel.  To provide best effort SRTP, ZRTP utilizes normal RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) profiles.  ZRTP secures media sessions that include a voice media stream and can also secure media sessions that do not include voice by using an optional digital signature.

RTP Payload Format for Scalable Video

Furthermore, it supports transmission of an SVC stream over a single as well as multiple RTP sessions.  The payload format defines a new media subtype name H264-SVC, but is still backward compatible to RFC 6184 since the base layer, when encapsulated in its own RTP stream, must use the H.264 media subtype name (H264) and the packetization method specified in RFC 6184.

However, there are cases where it is not recommended to forward feedback reports, and this may allow feedback implosion.
