In addition, support for strong security (and its negotiation), COMPOUND operations, client caching, and internationalization has been added.

Generic Security Service API Version 2:
Java Bindings Update
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8353.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) offers application programmers uniform access to security services atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms. This document updates the Java bindings for the GSS-API that are specified in Generic Security Service API Version 2: Java Bindings Update (RFC 5653). This document obsoletes RFC 5653 by adding a new output token field to the GSSException class so that when the initSecContext or acceptSecContext methods of the GSSContext class fail, it has a chance to emit an error token that can be sent to the peer for debugging or informational purpose. The stream-based GSSContext methods are also removed in this version. The GSS-API is described at a language-independent conceptual level in Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2, Update 1 (RFC 2743). The GSS-API allows a caller application to authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis. Examples of security mechanisms defined for GSS-API are The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism (SPKM) (RFC 2025) and The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2 (RFC 4121)."];
