Optimized Link State Routing Protocol
(OLSR)
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3626.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks.  The protocol is an optimization of the classical link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of a mobile wireless LAN.  The key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs).  MPRs are selected nodes which forward broadcast messages during the flooding process.  This technique substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it receives the first copy of the message.  In OLSR, link state information is generated only by nodes elected as MPRs.  Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control messages flooded in the network.  As a third optimization, an MPR node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors.  Hence, as contrary to the classic link state algorithm, partial link state information is distributed in the network.  This information is then used for route calculation.  OLSR provides optimal routes (in terms of number of hops).  The protocol is particularly suitable for large and dense networks as the technique of MPRs works well in this context."];

Information-Centric Networking (ICN)
Adaptation to Low-Power Wireless

A new frame format is specified to adapt CCNx and NDN packets to the small MTU size of IEEE 802.15.4. For that, syntactic and semantic changes to the TLV-based header formats are described. To support compatibility with other LoWPAN technologies that may coexist on a wireless medium, the dispatching scheme provided by IPv6 over LoWPAN (6LoWPAN) is extended to include new dispatch types for CCNx and NDN. Additionally, the fragmentation component of the 6LoWPAN dispatching framework is applied to Information-Centric Network (ICN) chunks. In its second part, the document defines stateless and stateful compression schemes to improve efficiency on constrained links. Stateless compression reduces TLV expressions to static header fields for common use cases. Stateful compression schemes elide states local to the LoWPAN and replace names in Data packets by short local identifiers.
