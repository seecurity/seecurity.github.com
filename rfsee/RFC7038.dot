Use of OSPF-MDR in Single-Hop Broadcast
Networks
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface of type MANET.  This document describes the use of OSPF-MDR (MANET Designated Router) in a single-hop broadcast network, which is a special case of a MANET in which each router is a (one-hop) neighbor of each other router.  Unlike an OSPF broadcast interface, such an interface can have a different cost associated with each neighbor.  The document includes configuration recommendations and simplified mechanisms that can be used in single-hop broadcast networks.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Extension
of OSPF Using Connected Dominating Set
(CDS) Flooding
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5614.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies an extension of OSPFv3 to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).  The extension, called OSPF-MDR, is designed as a new OSPF interface type for MANETs.  OSPF-MDR is based on the selection of a subset of MANET routers, consisting of MANET Designated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs.  The MDRs form a connected dominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs together form a biconnected CDS for robustness.  This CDS is exploited in two ways.  First, to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedure is used in which only (Backup) MDRs flood new link state advertisements (LSAs) back out the receiving interface; reliable flooding is ensured by retransmitting LSAs along adjacencies.  Second, adjacencies are formed only between (Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors, allowing for much better scaling in dense networks.  The CDS is constructed using 2-hop neighbor information provided in a Hello protocol extension.  The Hello protocol is further optimized by allowing differential Hellos that report only changes in neighbor states.  Options are specified for originating router-LSAs that provide full or partial topology information, allowing overhead to be reduced by advertising less topology information.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

OSPF for IPv6
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5340.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the modifications to OSPF to support version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6). The fundamental mechanisms of OSPF (flooding, Designated Router (DR) election, area support, Short Path First (SPF) calculations, etc.) remain unchanged. However, some changes have been necessary, either due to changes in protocol semantics between IPv4 and IPv6, or simply to handle the increased address size of IPv6. These modifications will necessitate incrementing the protocol version from version 2 to version 3. OSPF for IPv6 is also referred to as OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3). Changes between OSPF for IPv4, OSPF Version 2, and OSPF for IPv6 as described herein include the following. Addressing semantics have been removed from OSPF packets and the basic Link State Advertisements (LSAs). New LSAs have been created to carry IPv6 addresses and prefixes. OSPF now runs on a per-link basis rather than on a per-IP-subnet basis. Flooding scope for LSAs has been generalized. Authentication has been removed from the OSPF protocol and instead relies on IPv6's Authentication Header and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). Even with larger IPv6 addresses, most packets in OSPF for IPv6 are almost as compact as those in OSPF for IPv4. Most fields and packet- size limitations present in OSPF for IPv4 have been relaxed. In addition, option handling has been made more flexible. All of OSPF for IPv4's optional capabilities, including demand circuit support and Not-So-Stubby Areas (NSSAs), are also supported in OSPF for IPv6. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

OSPF Hybrid Broadcast and Point-to-
Multipoint Interface Type
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6845.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism to model a broadcast network as a hybrid of broadcast and point-to-multipoint networks for purposes of OSPF operation. Neighbor discovery and maintenance as well as Link State Advertisement (LSA) database synchronization are performed using the broadcast model, but the network is represented using the point-to-multipoint model in the router-LSAs of the routers connected to it. This allows an accurate representation of the cost of communication between different routers on the network, while maintaining the network efficiency of broadcast operation. This approach is relatively simple and requires minimal changes to OSPF. This document updates both OSPFv2 (RFC 2328) and OSPFv3 (RFC 5340). [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
