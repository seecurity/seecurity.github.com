Reliable link layer protocols

The stated need is reliable communication between two programs over a full-duplex, point-to-point communication link, and in particular the RFCs address the need for such communication over an asynchronous link at relatively low speeds.  The suggested protocol uses the methods of existing national and international data link layer standards.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
