Reliable link layer protocols
1985", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This RFC discusses protocols proposed recently in RFCs 914 and 916, and suggests a proposed protocol that could meet the same needs addressed in those memos.  The stated need is reliable communication between two programs over a full-duplex, point-to-point communication link, and in particular the RFCs address the need for such communication over an asynchronous link at relatively low speeds.  The suggested protocol uses the methods of existing national and international data link layer standards.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
