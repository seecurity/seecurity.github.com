Internet Fax Gateway Requirements
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="To allow connectivity between the General Switched Telephone Network facsimile service (GSTN fax) and the e-mail-based Internet Fax service (i-fax) an Internet Fax Gateway is required.  This document provides recommendations for the functionality of Internet Fax Gateways.  In this context, an offramp gateway provides facsimile data transmission from i-fax to GSTN fax; vice versa, an onramp gateway provides data transmission form GSTN fax to i-fax.  The recommendations in this document apply to the integrated service including Internet Fax terminals, computers with i-fax software on the Internet, and GSTN Fax terminals on the GSTN.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
