OSPFv2 Extensions for Bit Index Explicit
Replication (BIER)
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8444.html", target="_top", tooltip="Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a BIER domain without requiring intermediate routers to maintain multicast-related, per- flow state. BIER also does not require an explicit tree-building protocol for its operation. A multicast data packet enters a BIER domain at a Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router (BFIR) and leaves the BIER domain at one or more Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers (BFERs). The BFIR adds a BIER packet header to the packet. The BIER packet header contains a BitString in which each bit represents exactly one BFER to forward the packet to. The set of BFERs to which the multicast packet needs to be forwarded is expressed by the set of bits in the BIER packet header. This document describes the OSPF protocol extension (from RFC 2328) that is required for BIER with MPLS encapsulation (which is defined in RFC 8296). Support for other encapsulation types and the use of multiple encapsulation types are outside the scope of this document."];

Multicast Using Bit Index Explicit
Replication (BIER)
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8279.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast data packets.  It provides optimal forwarding of multicast packets through a multicast domain.  However, it does not require a protocol for explicitly building multicast distribution trees, nor does it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow state.  This architecture is known as Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER).  When a multicast data packet enters the domain, the ingress router determines the set of egress routers to which the packet needs to be sent.  The ingress router then encapsulates the packet in a BIER header.  The BIER header contains a bit string in which each bit represents exactly one egress router in the domain; to forward the packet to a given set of egress routers, the bits corresponding to those routers are set in the BIER header.  The procedures for forwarding a packet based on its BIER header are specified in this document.  Elimination of the per-flow state and the explicit tree-building protocols results in a considerable simplification."];
