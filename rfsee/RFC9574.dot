Optimized Ingress Replication Solution
for Ethernet VPNs (EVPNs)
2024", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) networks using Ethernet VPNs (EVPNs) as their control plane may use trees based on ingress replication or Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) to convey the overlay Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, or Multicast (BUM) traffic.  PIM provides an efficient solution that prevents sending multiple copies of the same packet over the same physical link; however, it may not always be deployed in the NVO network core.  Ingress replication avoids the dependency on PIM in the NVO network core.  While ingress replication provides a simple multicast transport, some NVO networks with demanding multicast applications require a more efficient solution without PIM in the core.  This document describes a solution to optimize the efficiency of ingress replication trees.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

EVPN Optimized Inter-Subnet Multicast
(OISM) Forwarding
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9625.html", target="_top", tooltip="Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides a service that allows a single Local Area Network (LAN), comprising a single IP subnet, to be divided into multiple segments.  Each segment may be located at a different site, and the segments are interconnected by an IP or MPLS backbone.  Intra-subnet traffic (either unicast or multicast) always appears to the end users to be bridged, even when it is actually carried over the IP or MPLS backbone.  When a single tenant owns multiple such LANs, EVPN also allows IP unicast traffic to be routed between those LANs.  This document specifies new procedures that allow inter-subnet IP multicast traffic to be routed among the LANs of a given tenant while still making intra-subnet IP multicast traffic appear to be bridged.  These procedures can provide optimal routing of the inter-subnet multicast traffic and do not require any such traffic to egress a given router and then ingress that same router.  These procedures also accommodate IP multicast traffic that originates or is destined to be external to the EVPN domain."];

This document specifies extensions to the EVPN multicast procedures that allow for the suppression of duplicate IP multicast traffic from redundant sources.
