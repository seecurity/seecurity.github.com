Unmanaged Networks IPv6 Transition
Scenarios
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3750.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the scenarios in which IPv6 transition mechanisms are to be used in unmanaged networks.  In order to evaluate the suitability of these mechanisms, we need to define the scenarios in which these mechanisms have to be used.  One specific scope is the unmanaged network, which typically corresponds to a home or small office network.  The scenarios are specific to a single subnet, and are defined in terms of IP connectivity supported by the gateway and the Internet Service Provider (ISP).  We first examine the generic requirements of four classes of applications: local, client, peer to peer and server.  Then, for each scenario, we infer transition requirements by analyzing the needs for smooth migration of applications from IPv4 to IPv6.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Enterprise deployment requirements are discussed in terms of coexistence with IPv4 nodes, networks and applications, and in terms of basic network infrastructure requirements for IPv6 deployment.  The scenarios and requirements described in this document will be the basis for further analysis to determine what coexistence techniques and mechanisms are needed for enterprise IPv6 deployment.

The overall problem for many administrators will be to offer Internet- facing services over IPv6 while continuing to support IPv4, and while introducing IPv6 access within the enterprise IT network.  The overall transition will take most networks from an IPv4-only environment to a dual-stack network environment and eventually an IPv6-only operating mode.
