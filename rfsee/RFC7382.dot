An Infrastructure to Support Secure
Internet Routing
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6480.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes an architecture for an infrastructure to support improved security of Internet routing.  The foundation of this architecture is a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) that represents the allocation hierarchy of IP address space and Autonomous System (AS) numbers; and a distributed repository system for storing and disseminating the data objects that comprise the RPKI, as well as other signed objects necessary for improved routing security.  As an initial application of this architecture, the document describes how a legitimate holder of IP address space can explicitly and verifiably authorize one or more ASes to originate routes to that address space.  Such verifiable authorizations could be used, for example, to more securely construct BGP route filters.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Manifests for the Resource Public Key
Infrastructure (RPKI)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6486.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a manifest for use in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  A manifest is a signed object (file) that contains a listing of all the signed objects (files) in the repository publication point (directory) associated with an authority responsible for publishing in the repository.  For each certificate, Certificate Revocation List (CRL), or other type of signed objects issued by the authority that are published at this repository publication point, the manifest contains both the name of the file containing the object and a hash of the file content.  Manifests are intended to enable a relying party (RP) to detect certain forms of attacks against a repository.  Specifically, if an RP checks a manifest's contents against the signed objects retrieved from a repository publication point, then the RP can detect stale (valid) data and deletion of signed objects.
