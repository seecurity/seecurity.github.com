Handling Long Lines in Content of
Internet-Drafts and RFCs
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8792.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in width-bounded text content.  One strategy, called the single backslash strategy, is based on the historical use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where line-folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character that is not a space character (' ') on the next line.  The second strategy, called the double backslash strategy, extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the continuation begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported by the first strategy.  Both strategies use a self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the original content."];

Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):
Generic Syntax
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3986.html", target="_top", tooltip="A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.  The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8126.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters. To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry. This is the third edition of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226."];
