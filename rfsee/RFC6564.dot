Depth-First Forwarding (DFF) in
Unreliable Networks
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6971.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies the Depth-First Forwarding (DFF) protocol for IPv6 networks, a data-forwarding mechanism that can increase reliability of data delivery in networks with dynamic topology and/or lossy links.  The protocol operates entirely on the forwarding plane but may interact with the routing plane.  DFF forwards data packets using a mechanism similar to a depth-first search for the destination of a packet.  The routing plane may be informed of failures to deliver a packet or loops.  This document specifies the DFF mechanism both for IPv6 networks (as specified in RFC 2460) and for mesh-under Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs), as specified in RFC 4944.  The design of DFF assumes that the underlying link layer provides means to detect if a packet has been successfully delivered to the Next Hop or not.  It is applicable for networks with little traffic and is used for unicast transmissions only."];

IPv4, IPv6, and IPv4-IPv6 Coexistence:
Updates for the IP Performance Metrics

It updates the definition of standard-formed packets to include IPv6 packets, deprecates the definition of minimal IP packet, and augments distinguishing aspects, referred to as Type-P, for test packets in RFC 2330.  This memo identifies that IPv4-IPv6 coexistence can challenge measurements within the scope of the IPPM framework.  Example use cases include, but are not limited to, IPv4-IPv6 translation, NAT, and protocol encapsulation.  IPv6 header compression and use of IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Area Networks (6LoWPAN) are considered and excluded from the standard-formed packet evaluation."];
