This memo covers NAT traversal approaches used by both TCP- and UDP-based applications.  This memo is not an endorsement of the methods described, but merely an attempt to capture them in a document.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration in IPv6
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4941.html", target="_top", tooltip="Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate addresses using a combination of locally available information and information advertised by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining network prefixes with an interface identifier.  On an interface that contains an embedded IEEE Identifier, the interface identifier is typically derived from it.  On other interface types, the interface identifier is generated through other means, for example, via random number generation.  This document describes an extension to IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration for interfaces whose interface identifier is derived from an IEEE identifier.  Use of the extension causes nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface identifiers that change over time, even in cases where the interface contains an embedded IEEE identifier.  Changing the interface identifier (and the global scope addresses generated from it) over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to identify when different addresses used in different transactions actually correspond to the same node.

This document also defines elements of a procedure for NAT traversal, including the optional use of a HIP relay server.  With these extensions HIP is able to work in environments that have NATs and provides a generic NAT traversal solution to higher-layer networking applications.
