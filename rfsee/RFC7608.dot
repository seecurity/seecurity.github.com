IPv6 Prefix Length Recommendation for
Forwarding
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="IPv6 prefix length, as in IPv4, is a parameter conveyed and used in IPv6 routing and forwarding processes in accordance with the Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR) architecture.  The length of an IPv6 prefix may be any number from zero to 128, although subnets using stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for address allocation conventionally use a /64 prefix.  Hardware and software implementations of routing and forwarding should therefore impose no rules on prefix length, but implement longest-match-first on prefixes of any valid length.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
