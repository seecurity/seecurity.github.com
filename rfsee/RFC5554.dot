On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure

2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5056.html", target="_top", tooltip="The concept of channel binding allows applications to establish that the two end-points of a secure channel at one network layer are the same as at a higher layer by binding authentication at the higher layer to the channel at the lower layer. This allows applications to delegate session protection to lower layers, which has various performance benefits.

This mechanism family offers a number of improvements over the previous SASL/ GSSAPI mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer messages for the authentication phase in some cases, and supports negotiable use of channel binding.  Only GSS-API mechanisms that support channel binding and mutual authentication are supported. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
