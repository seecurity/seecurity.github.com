This document provides the latest recommendations for ensuring the security of deployed services that use TLS and DTLS. These recommendations are applicable to the majority of use cases. RFC 7525, an earlier version of the TLS recommendations, was published when the industry was transitioning to TLS 1.2. Years later, this transition is largely complete, and TLS 1.3 is widely available. This document updates the guidance given the new environment and obsoletes RFC 7525. In addition, this document updates RFCs 5288 and 6066 in view of recent attacks."];

Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE
(EDHOC)
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9528.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC), a very compact and lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange with ephemeral keys.  EDHOC provides mutual authentication, forward secrecy, and identity protection.  EDHOC is intended for usage in constrained scenarios, and a main use case is to establish an Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) security context.  By reusing CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) for cryptography, Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) for encoding, and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for transport, the additional code size can be kept very low."];

No Revocation Available for X.509 Public
Key Certificates
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9608.html", target="_top", tooltip="X.509v3 public key certificates are profiled in RFC 5280.  Short-lived certificates are seeing greater use in the Internet.  The Certification Authority (CA) that issues these short-lived certificates do not publish revocation information because the certificate lifespan that is shorter than the time needed to detect, report, and distribute revocation information.  Some long-lived X.509v3 public key certificates never expire, and they are never revoked.  This specification defines the noRevAvail certificate extension so that a relying party can readily determine that the CA does not publish revocation information for the certificate, and it updates the certification path validation algorithm defined in RFC 5280 so that revocation checking is skipped when the noRevAvail certificate extension is present."];

Online Certificate Status Protocol
(OCSP) Nonce Extension
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9654.html", target="_top", tooltip="RFC 8954 imposed size constraints on the optional Nonce extension for the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). OCSP is used to check the status of a certificate, and the Nonce extension is used to cryptographically bind an OCSP response message to a particular OCSP request message. Some environments use cryptographic algorithms that generate a Nonce value that is longer than 32 octets. This document also modifies the Nonce section of RFC 6960 to clearly define and differentiate the encoding format and values for easier implementation and understanding. This document obsoletes RFC 8954, which includes updated ASN.1 modules for OCSP, and updates RFC 6960."];
