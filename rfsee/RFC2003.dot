DSR allows the network to be completely self-organizing and self-configuring, without the need for any existing network infrastructure or administration.  The protocol is composed of the two main mechanisms of Route Discovery and Route Maintenance, which work together to allow nodes to discover and maintain routes to arbitrary destinations in the ad hoc network.  All aspects of the protocol operate entirely on demand, allowing the routing packet overhead of DSR to scale automatically to only what is needed to react to changes in the routes currently in use.  The protocol allows multiple routes to any destination and allows each sender to select and control the routes used in routing its packets, for example, for use in load balancing or for increased robustness.  Other advantages of the DSR protocol include easily guaranteed loop-free routing, operation in networks containing unidirectional links, use of only soft state in routing, and very rapid recovery when routes in the network change.  The DSR protocol is designed mainly for mobile ad hoc networks of up to about two hundred nodes and is designed to work well even with very high rates of mobility.

While Quick-Start is designed to be used by a range of transport protocols, in this document we only specify its use with TCP. Quick-Start is designed to allow connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers along the path approve the Quick-Start Request. This document describes many paths where Quick-Start Requests would not be approved. These paths include all paths containing routers, IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start. These paths also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing IP options. Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that include multi-access layer- two networks. This document also describes environments where the Quick-Start process could fail with false positives, with the sender incorrectly assuming that the Quick-Start Request had been approved by all of the routers along the path. As a result of these concerns, and as a result of the difficulties and seeming absence of motivation for routers, such as core routers to deploy Quick-Start, Quick-Start is being proposed as a mechanism that could be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet.

The QSPEC parameters provide a common language to be reused in several QOSMs and thereby aim to ensure the extensibility and interoperability of QoS NSLP.  While the base protocol is QOSM-agnostic, the parameters that can be carried in the QSPEC object are possibly closely coupled to specific models.

Therefore, the resulting tunnel segments could become the weakest QoS link and invalidate the QoS efforts in the rest of the end-to-end path.  The problem with NSIS signaling within the tunnel is caused by the tunnel encapsulation that masks packets' original IP header fields.  Those original IP header fields are needed to intercept NSIS signaling messages and classify QoS data packets.

Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion
Notification

On decapsulation, it updates both RFC 3168 and RFC 4301 to add new behaviours for previously unused combinations of inner and outer headers.  The new rules ensure the ECN field is correctly propagated across a tunnel whether it is used to signal one or two severity levels of congestion; whereas before, only one severity level was supported.  Tunnel endpoints can be updated in any order without affecting pre-existing uses of the ECN field, thus ensuring backward compatibility.  Nonetheless, operators wanting to support two severity levels (e.g., for pre-congestion notification -- PCN) can require compliance with this new specification.

Making TCP More Robust to Long
Connectivity Disruptions (TCP-LCD)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6069.html", target="_top", tooltip="Disruptions in end-to-end path connectivity, which last longer than one retransmission timeout, cause suboptimal TCP performance. The reason for this performance degradation is that TCP interprets segment loss induced by long connectivity disruptions as a sign of congestion, resulting in repeated retransmission timer backoffs. This, in turn, leads to a delayed detection of the re-establishment of the connection since TCP waits for the next retransmission timeout before it attempts a retransmission. This document proposes an algorithm to make TCP more robust to long connectivity disruptions (TCP-LCD). It describes how standard ICMP messages can be exploited during timeout-based loss recovery to disambiguate true congestion loss from non-congestion loss caused by connectivity disruptions. Moreover, a reversion strategy of the retransmission timer is specified that enables a more prompt detection of whether or not the connectivity to a previously disconnected peer node has been restored. TCP-LCD is a TCP sender- only modification that effectively improves TCP performance in the case of connectivity disruptions.

FQ-CoDel mixes packets from multiple flows and reduces the impact of head-of-line blocking from bursty traffic. It provides isolation for low-rate traffic such as DNS, web, and videoconferencing traffic. It improves utilisation across the networking fabric, especially for bidirectional traffic, by keeping queue lengths short, and it can be implemented in a memory- and CPU-efficient fashion across a wide range of hardware."];

Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation for Data
Frames in Control and Provisioning of
Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8350.html", target="_top", tooltip="Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) is a protocol for encapsulating a station's data frames between the Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller (AC).  Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data frames can be either locally bridged or tunneled to the AC.  When tunneled, a CAPWAP Data Channel is used for tunneling.  In many deployments, encapsulating data frames to an entity other than the AC (for example, to an Access Router (AR)) is desirable.  Furthermore, it may also be desirable to use different tunnel encapsulation modes between the WTP and the Access Router.  This document defines an extension to the CAPWAP protocol that supports this capability and refers to it as alternate tunnel encapsulation.  The alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint different from the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many known encapsulation types, such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, or CAPWAP.  The WTP may advertise support for alternate tunnel encapsulation during the discovery and join process, and the AC may select one of the supported alternate tunnel encapsulation types while configuring the WTP."];

A YANG Data Model for Tunnel Interface
Types
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8675.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies the initial version of a YANG module iana-tunnel-type, which contains a collection of IANA-maintained YANG identities used as interface types for tunnel interfaces. The module reflects the tunnelType registry maintained by IANA. The latest revision of this YANG module can be obtained from the IANA website. Tunnel type values are not directly added to the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module; they must instead be added to the tunnelType IANA registry. Once a new tunnel type registration is made by IANA for a new tunneling scheme or even an existing one that is not already listed in the current registry (e.g., LISP, NSH), IANA will update the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module accordingly. Some of the IETF-defined tunneling techniques are not listed in the current IANA registry. It is not the intent of this document to update the existing IANA registry with a comprehensive list of tunnel technologies. Registrants must follow the IETF registration procedure for interface types whenever a new tunnel type is needed."];

Guidelines for Adding Congestion

The aim is for explicit congestion signals to propagate consistently from lower-layer protocols into IP.  Then, the IP internetwork layer can act as a portability layer to carry congestion notification from non-IP-aware congested nodes up to the transport layer (L4).  Specifications that follow these guidelines, whether produced by the IETF or other standards bodies, should assure interworking among IP-layer and lower-layer congestion notification mechanisms.  This document is included in BCP 89 and updates the single paragraph of advice to subnetwork designers about Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in Section 13 of RFC 3819 by replacing it with a reference to this document."];
