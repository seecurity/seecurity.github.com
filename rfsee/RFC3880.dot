Call Processing Language (CPL): A
Language for User Control of Internet
Telephony Services
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines the Call Processing Language (CPL), a language to describe and control Internet telephony services.  It is designed to be implementable on either network servers or user agents.  It is meant to be simple, extensible, easily edited by graphical clients, and independent of operating system or signalling protocol.  It is suitable for running on a server where users may not be allowed to execute arbitrary programs, as it has no variables, loops, or ability to run external programs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A Framework for Consent-Based

In its current form, it allows session invitations, instant messages, and other requests to be delivered from one party to another without requiring explicit consent of the recipient.  Without such consent, it is possible for SIP to be used for malicious purposes, including amplification and DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.  This document identifies a framework for consent-based communications in SIP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A Call Control and Multi-Party Usage
Framework for the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5850.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a framework and the requirements for call control and multi-party usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  To enable discussion of multi-party features and applications, we define an abstract call model for describing the media relationships required by many of these.  The model and actions described here are specifically chosen to be independent of the SIP signaling and/or mixing approach chosen to actually set up the media relationships.  In addition to its dialog manipulation aspect, this framework includes requirements for communicating related information and events such as conference and session state and session history.  This framework also describes other goals that embody the spirit of SIP applications as used on the Internet such as the definition of primitives (not services), invoker and participant oriented primitives, signaling and mixing model independence, and others.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
