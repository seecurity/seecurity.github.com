Service provider (SP) IP/MPLS networks need an MPLS GCAC mechanism, as one motivational example, to reject Voice over IP (VoIP) calls when additional calls would adversely affect calls already in progress.  Without MPLS GCAC, connections on congested links will suffer degraded quality.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm can be optionally implemented in vendor equipment and deployed by service providers.  MPLS GCAC interoperates between vendor equipment and across multiple service provider domains.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm uses available standard mechanisms for MPLS-based networks, such as RSVP, Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE), Path Computation Element (PCE), Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS), Diffserv, and OSPF.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm does not include aspects of CAC that might be considered vendor proprietary implementations, such as detailed path selection mechanisms.  MPLS GCAC functions are implemented in a distributed manner to deliver the objective Quality of Service (QoS) for specified QoS constraints.  The objective is that the source is able to compute a source route with high likelihood that via-elements along the selected path will in fact admit the request.  In some cases (e.g., multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes)), this objective cannot always be met, but this document summarizes methods that partially meet this objective.  MPLS GCAC is applicable to any service or flow that must meet an objective QoS (delay, jitter, packet loss rate) for a specified quantity of traffic.

IGP Flexible Algorithm
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9350.html", target="_top", tooltip="IGP protocols historically compute the best paths over the network based on the IGP metric assigned to the links.  Many network deployments use RSVP-TE or Segment Routing - Traffic Engineering (SR-TE) to steer traffic over a path that is computed using different metrics or constraints than the shortest IGP path.  This document specifies a solution that allows IGPs themselves to compute constraint-based paths over the network.  This document also specifies a way of using Segment Routing (SR) Prefix-SIDs and SRv6 locators to steer packets along the constraint-based paths."];

IS-IS Application-Specific Link
Attributes
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9479.html", target="_top", tooltip="Existing traffic-engineering-related link attribute advertisements have been defined and are used in RSVP-TE deployments. Since the original RSVP-TE use case was defined, additional applications (e.g., Segment Routing Policy and Loop-Free Alternates) that also make use of the link attribute advertisements have been defined. In cases where multiple applications wish to make use of these link attributes, the current advertisements do not support application-specific values for a given attribute, nor do they support an indication of which applications are using the advertised value for a given link. This document introduces link attribute advertisements that address both of these shortcomings. This document obsoletes RFC 8919."];

Distribution of Link-State and Traffic
Engineering Information Using BGP
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9552.html", target="_top", tooltip="In many environments, a component external to a network is called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and the current state of the connections within the network, including Traffic Engineering (TE) information. This is information typically distributed by IGP routing protocols within the network. This document describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE information can be collected from networks and shared with external components using the BGP routing protocol. This is achieved using a BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding format. The mechanism applies to physical and virtual (e.g., tunnel) IGP links. The mechanism described is subject to policy control. Applications of this technique include Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) servers and Path Computation Elements (PCEs). This document obsoletes RFC 7752 by completely replacing that document. It makes some small changes and clarifications to the previous specification. This document also obsoletes RFC 9029 by incorporating the updates that it made to RFC 7752."];

Area Proxy for IS-IS
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9666.html", target="_top", tooltip="Link-state routing protocols have hierarchical abstraction already built into them. However, when lower levels are used for transit, they must expose their internal topologies to each other, thereby leading to scaling issues. To avoid such issues, this document discusses extensions to the IS-IS routing protocol that allow Level 1 (L1) areas to provide transit but only inject an abstraction of the Level 1 topology into Level 2 (L2). Each Level 1 area is represented as a single Level 2 node, thereby enabling a greater scale."];

Interworking of GMPLS Control and
Centralized Controller Systems
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9730.html", target="_top", tooltip="Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows each network element (NE) to perform local resource discovery, routing, and signaling in a distributed manner. The advancement of software-defined transport networking technology enables a group of NEs to be managed through centralized controller hierarchies. This helps to tackle challenges arising from multiple domains, vendors, and technologies. An example of such a centralized architecture is the Abstraction and Control of Traffic-Engineered Networks (ACTN) controller hierarchy, as described in RFC 8453. Both the distributed and centralized control planes have their respective advantages and should complement each other in the system, rather than compete. This document outlines how the GMPLS distributed control plane can work together with a centralized controller system in a transport network."];
