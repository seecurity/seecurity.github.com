for IPv6 Transition

As IPv4 address exhaustion approaches, IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues become more critical and less tractable. Host-based transition mechanisms used in dual-stack environments cannot meet all transition requirements. Most end users are not sufficiently expert to configure or maintain host-based transition mechanisms. Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) devices with integrated transition mechanisms can reduce the operational changes required during the IPv4 to IPv6 migration or coexistence period. This document proposes an incremental CGN approach for IPv6 transition. It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6 hosts and IPv4 access services for IPv4 hosts while leaving much of a legacy ISP network unchanged during the initial stage of IPv4 to IPv6 migration. Unlike CGN alone, incremental CGN also supports and encourages smooth transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks. An integrated configurable CGN device and an adaptive home gateway (HG) device are described. Both are reusable during different transition phases, avoiding multiple upgrades.

6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6732.html", target="_top", tooltip="6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels (6to4-PMT) provide a framework that can help manage 6to4 tunnels operating in an anycast configuration.  The 6to4-PMT framework is intended to serve as an option for operators to help improve the experience of 6to4 operation when conditions of the network may provide sub-optimal performance or break normal 6to4 operation.  6to4-PMT supplies a stable provider prefix and forwarding environment by utilizing existing 6to4 relays with an added function of IPv6 Prefix Translation.  This operation may be particularly important in NAT444 infrastructures where a customer endpoint may be assigned a non-RFC1918 address, thus breaking the return path for anycast-based 6to4 operation.  6to4-PMT has been successfully used in a production network, implemented as open source code, and implemented by a major routing vendor.

Native IPv6 behind IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT
Customer Premises Equipment (6a44)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6751.html", target="_top", tooltip="In customer sites having IPv4-only Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), Teredo (RFC 4380, RFC 5991, RFC 6081) provides last-resort IPv6 connectivity.  However, because it is designed to work without the involvement of Internet Service Providers, it has significant limitations (connectivity between IPv6 native addresses and Teredo addresses is uncertain; connectivity between Teredo addresses fails for some combinations of NAT types).  6a44 is a complementary solution that, being based on ISP cooperation, avoids these limitations.  At the beginning of 6a44 IPv6 addresses, it replaces the Teredo well-known prefix, present at the beginning of Teredo IPv6 addresses, with network-specific /48 prefixes assigned by local ISPs (an evolution similar to that from 6to4 to 6rd (IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures)).  The specification is expected to be complete enough for running code to be independently written and the solution to be incrementally deployed and used.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Wireline Incremental IPv6
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6782.html", target="_top", tooltip="Operators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for or deploying IPv6 in their networks.  These operators often face difficult challenges related to IPv6 introduction, along with those related to IPv4 run-out.  Operators will need to meet the simultaneous needs of IPv6 connectivity and continue support for IPv4 connectivity for legacy devices with a stagnant supply of IPv4 addresses.  The IPv6 transition will take most networks from an IPv4- only environment to an IPv6-dominant environment with long transition periods varying by operator.  This document helps provide a framework for wireline providers who are faced with the challenges of introducing IPv6 along with meeting the legacy needs of IPv4 connectivity, utilizing well-defined and commercially available IPv6 transition technologies.

The event was largely unnoticed by the general public, which is a good thing since it means that no major problems were detected.  For the Internet, however, there was a major change on a short timescale.  This memo discusses measurements that the authors made from the perspective of an end user with good IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity.  Our measurements include the number of most popular networks providing AAAA records for their service, as well as delay and connection failure statistics."];

Some of the IETF-defined tunneling techniques are not listed in the current IANA registry.
