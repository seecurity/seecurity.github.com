The EVPN specifications allow a single P2MP tunnel to carry traffic of multiple Broadcast Domains (BDs).  These features require the ingress router of the P2MP tunnel to allocate an upstream-assigned MPLS label for each VPN or for each BD.  A packet sent on a P2MP tunnel then carries the label that is mapped to its VPN or BD (in some cases, a distinct upstream-assigned label is needed for each flow.) Since each ingress router allocates labels independently, with no coordination among the ingress routers, the egress routers may need to keep track of a large number of labels.  The number of labels may need to be as large as, or larger than, the product of the number of ingress routers times the number of VPNs or BDs.  However, the number of labels can be greatly reduced if the association between a label and a VPN or BD is made by provisioning, so that all ingress routers assign the same label to a particular VPN or BD.  New procedures are needed in order to take advantage of such provisioned labels.  These new procedures also apply to Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) tunnels.

These features require the ingress router of the P2MP tunnel to allocate an upstream-assigned MPLS label for each VPN or for each BD.  A packet sent on a P2MP tunnel then carries the label that is mapped to its VPN or BD (in some cases, a distinct upstream-assigned label is needed for each flow.) Since each ingress router allocates labels independently, with no coordination among the ingress routers, the egress routers may need to keep track of a large number of labels.

Multipoint LDP Extensions for Multi-
Topology Routing
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9658.html", target="_top", tooltip="Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) is a technology that enables service differentiation within an IP network.  The Flexible Algorithm (FA) is another mechanism for creating a sub-topology within a topology using defined topology constraints and computation algorithms.  In order to deploy Multipoint LDP (mLDP) in a network that supports MTR, FA, or other methods of signaling non-default IGP Algorithms (IPAs), mLDP is required to become topology and algorithm aware.  This document specifies extensions to mLDP to support the use of MTR/IPAs such that, when building multipoint Label Switched Paths (LSPs), the LSPs can follow a particular topology and algorithm.  This document updates RFC 7307 by allocating eight bits from a previously reserved field to be used as the IPA field."];

Multicast Source Redundancy in EVPNs
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9856.html", target="_top", tooltip="In Ethernet Virtual Private Networks (EVPNs), IP multicast traffic replication and delivery play a crucial role in enabling efficient and scalable Layer 2 and Layer 3 services.  A common deployment scenario involves redundant multicast sources that ensure high availability and resiliency.  However, the presence of redundant sources can lead to duplicate IP multicast traffic in the network, causing inefficiencies and increased overhead.  This document specifies extensions to the EVPN multicast procedures that allow for the suppression of duplicate IP multicast traffic from redundant sources.  The proposed mechanisms enhance the EVPN's capability to deliver multicast traffic efficiently while maintaining high availability.  These extensions are applicable to various EVPN deployment scenarios and provide guidelines to ensure consistent and predictable behavior across diverse network topologies."];
