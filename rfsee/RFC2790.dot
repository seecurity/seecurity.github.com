It has been designed to provide short time-till-playback for the end user and to prevent disruption of the streams by malicious peers.  PPSPP has also been designed to be flexible and extensible.  It can use different mechanisms to optimize peer uploading, prevent freeriding, and work with different peer discovery schemes (centralized trackers or Distributed Hash Tables).  It supports multiple methods for content integrity protection and chunk addressing.
