Problem Statement: Overlays for Network
Virtualization
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7364.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes issues associated with providing multi-tenancy in large data center networks and how these issues may be addressed using an overlay-based network virtualization approach.  A key multi-tenancy requirement is traffic isolation so that one tenant's traffic is not visible to any other tenant.  Another requirement is address space isolation so that different tenants can use the same address space within different virtual networks.  Traffic and address space isolation is achieved by assigning one or more virtual networks to each tenant, where traffic within a virtual network can only cross into another virtual network in a controlled fashion (e.g., via a configured router and/or a security gateway).  Additional functionality is required to provision virtual networks, associating a virtual machine's network interface(s) with the appropriate virtual network and maintaining that association as the virtual machine is activated, migrated, and/or deactivated.  Use of an overlay-based approach enables scalable deployment on large network infrastructures."];

It should be possible to build and implement individual components in isolation and have them interoperate with other independently implemented components.  That way, implementers have flexibility in implementing individual components and can optimize and innovate within their respective components without requiring changes to other components."];

Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion
Notification
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6040.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document redefines how the explicit congestion notification (ECN) field of the IP header should be constructed on entry to and exit from any IP-in-IP tunnel.  On encapsulation, it updates RFC 3168 to bring all IP-in-IP tunnels (v4 or v6) into line with RFC 4301 IPsec ECN processing.  On decapsulation, it updates both RFC 3168 and RFC 4301 to add new behaviours for previously unused combinations of inner and outer headers.  The new rules ensure the ECN field is correctly propagated across a tunnel whether it is used to signal one or two severity levels of congestion; whereas before, only one severity level was supported.  Tunnel endpoints can be updated in any order without affecting pre-existing uses of the ECN field, thus ensuring backward compatibility.  Nonetheless, operators wanting to support two severity levels (e.g., for pre-congestion notification -- PCN) can require compliance with this new specification.  A thorough analysis of the reasoning for these changes and the implications is included.  In the unlikely event that the new rules do not meet a specific need, RFC 4774 gives guidance on designing alternate ECN semantics, and this document extends that to include tunnelling issues.

Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using

Multiple VPLS services can be supported from a single Provider Edge (PE) node. This document describes the control plane functions of signaling pseudowire labels using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), extending RFC 4447. It is agnostic to discovery protocols.

For example, it may result in highly non-optimal bandwidth utilization when a large amount of multicast traffic is to be transported. This document describes solutions for overcoming a subset of the limitations of the existing VPLS multicast solution. It describes procedures for VPLS multicast that utilize multicast trees in the service provider (SP) network. The solution described in this document allows sharing of one such multicast tree among multiple VPLS instances. Furthermore, the solution described in this document allows a single multicast tree in the SP network to carry traffic belonging only to a specified set of one or more IP multicast streams from one or more VPLS instances."];

Multicast Using Bit Index Explicit
Replication (BIER)
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8279.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast data packets.  It provides optimal forwarding of multicast packets through a multicast domain.  However, it does not require a protocol for explicitly building multicast distribution trees, nor does it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow state.  This architecture is known as Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER).  When a multicast data packet enters the domain, the ingress router determines the set of egress routers to which the packet needs to be sent.  The ingress router then encapsulates the packet in a BIER header.  The BIER header contains a bit string in which each bit represents exactly one egress router in the domain; to forward the packet to a given set of egress routers, the bits corresponding to those routers are set in the BIER header.  The procedures for forwarding a packet based on its BIER header are specified in this document.  Elimination of the per-flow state and the explicit tree-building protocols results in a considerable simplification."];
