Topology Independent Fast Reroute Using
Segment Routing

This FRR behavior builds on proven IP FRR concepts being LFAs, Remote LFAs (RLFAs), and Directed Loop-Free Alternates (DLFAs).  It extends these concepts to provide guaranteed coverage in any two-connected networks using a link-state IGP.  An important aspect of TI-LFA is the FRR path selection approach establishing protection over the expected post-convergence paths from the Point of Local Repair (PLR), reducing the operational need to control the tie-breaks among various FRR options.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Basic Specification for IP Fast Reroute:
Loop-Free Alternates
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5286.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the use of loop-free alternates to provide local protection for unicast traffic in pure IP and MPLS/LDP networks in the event of a single failure, whether link, node, or shared risk link group (SRLG).  The goal of this technology is to reduce the packet loss that happens while routers converge after a topology change due to a failure.  Rapid failure repair is achieved through use of precalculated backup next-hops that are loop-free and safe to use until the distributed network convergence process completes.  This simple approach does not require any support from other routers.  The extent to which this goal can be met by this specification is dependent on the topology of the network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A Framework for Loop-Free Convergence

This framework provides a summary of the causes and consequences of micro-loops and enables the reader to form a judgement on whether micro-looping is an issue that needs to be addressed in specific networks. It also provides a survey of the currently proposed mechanisms that may be used to prevent or to suppress the formation of micro-loops when an IP or MPLS network undergoes topology change due to failure, repair, or management action. When sufficiently fast convergence is not available and the topology is susceptible to micro-loops, use of one or more of these mechanisms may be desirable.

Framework for Loop-Free Convergence
Using the Ordered Forwarding Information
Base (oFIB) Approach
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6976.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes an illustrative framework of a mechanism for use in conjunction with link-state routing protocols that prevents the transient loops that would otherwise occur during topology changes. It does this by correctly sequencing the forwarding information base (FIB) updates on the routers. This mechanism can be used in the case of non-urgent (management action) link or node shutdowns and restarts or link metric changes. It can also be used in conjunction with a fast reroute mechanism that converts a sudden link or node failure into a non-urgent topology change. This is possible where a complete repair path is provided for all affected destinations. After a non-urgent topology change, each router computes a rank that defines the time at which it can safely update its FIB. A method for accelerating this loop-free convergence process by the use of completion messages is also described. The technology described in this document has been subject to extensive simulation using pathological convergence behavior and real network topologies and costs. However, the mechanisms described in this document are purely illustrative of the general approach and do not constitute a protocol specification. This document represents a snapshot of the work of the Routing Area Working Group at the time of publication and is published as a document of record. Further work is needed before implementation or deployment."];

Micro-loop Prevention by Introducing a

2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8333.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism for link-state routing protocols that prevents local transient forwarding loops in case of link failure. This mechanism proposes a two-step convergence by introducing a delay between the convergence of the node adjacent to the topology change and the network-wide convergence. Because this mechanism delays the IGP convergence, it may only be used for planned maintenance or when Fast Reroute (FRR) protects the traffic during the time between the link failure and the IGP convergence. The mechanism is limited to the link-down event in order to keep the mechanism simple. Simulations using real network topologies have been performed and show that local loops are a significant portion (>50%) of the total forwarding loops."];

Segment Routing Architecture

A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called segments. A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service based.

SR provides a mechanism that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological path, while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SR domain. SR can be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change to the forwarding plane. A segment is encoded as an MPLS label. An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels. The segment to process is on the top of the stack. Upon completion of a segment, the related label is popped from the stack. SR can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header. A segment is encoded as an IPv6 address. An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing header. The active segment is indicated by the Destination Address (DA) of the packet.
