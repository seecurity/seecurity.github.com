Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Authenticated Identity Body (AIB) Format
2004", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="RFC 3261 introduces the concept of adding an S/MIME body to a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) request or response in order to provide reference integrity over its headers.  This document provides a more specific mechanism to derive integrity and authentication properties from an 'authenticated identity body', a digitally-signed SIP message, or message fragment.  A standard format for such bodies (known as Authenticated Identity Bodies, or AIBs) is given in this document.  Some considerations for the processing of AIBs by recipients of SIP messages with such bodies are also given.

Session PEERing for Multimedia
INTerconnect (SPEERMINT) Security
Threats and Suggested Countermeasures
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6404.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session PEERing for Multimedia INTerconnect (SPEERMINT) working group (WG) provides a peering framework that leverages the building blocks of existing IETF-defined protocols such as SIP and ENUM for the interconnection between SIP Service Providers (SSPs).  The objective of this document is to identify and enumerate SPEERMINT- specific threat vectors and to give guidance for implementers on selecting appropriate countermeasures.  Security requirements for SPEERMINT that have been derived from the threats detailed in this document can be found in RFC 6271; this document provides concrete countermeasures to meet those SPEERMINT security requirements.  In this document, the different security threats related to SPEERMINT are classified into threats to the Lookup Function (LUF), the Location Routing Function (LRF), the Signaling Function (SF), and the Media Function (MF) of a specific SIP Service Provider.  Various instances of the threats are briefly introduced inside the classification.  Finally, existing security solutions for SIP and RTP/RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol) are presented to describe countermeasures currently available for such threats.  Each SSP may have connections to one or more remote SSPs through peering or transit contracts.  A potentially compromised remote SSP that attacks other SSPs is out of the scope of this document; this document focuses on attacks on an SSP from outside the trust domain such an SSP may have with other SSPs.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
