Transparent Interconnection of Lots of
Links (TRILL): Fine-Grained Labeling
2014", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The IETF has standardized Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL), a protocol for least-cost transparent frame routing in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and link technologies, using link-state routing and a hop count.

However, there are applications that require a larger number of labels providing configurable isolation of data.  This document updates RFC 6325 by specifying optional extensions to the TRILL base protocol to safely accomplish this.

Traffic and address space isolation is achieved by assigning one or more virtual networks to each tenant, where traffic within a virtual network can only cross into another virtual network in a controlled fashion (e.g., via a configured router and/or a security gateway).

In particular, it learns local Media Access Control (MAC) addresses and the edge switch port of attachment from the receipt of local data frames and learns remote MAC addresses and the edge switch port of attachment from the decapsulation of remotely sourced TRILL Data packets. This document specifies a message by which a TRILL switch can explicitly request other TRILL switches to flush certain MAC reachability learned through the decapsulation of TRILL Data packets. This is a supplement to the TRILL automatic address forgetting (see Section 4.8.3 of RFC 6325) and can assist in achieving more rapid convergence in case of topology or configuration change."];

Transparent Interconnection of Lots of
Links (TRILL) Smart Endnodes
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8384.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document addresses the problem of the size and freshness of the endnode learning table in edge Routing Bridges (RBridges), by allowing endnodes to volunteer for endnode learning and encapsulation/decapsulation.  Such an endnode is known as a Smart Endnode.  Only the attached edge RBridge can distinguish a Smart Endnode from a normal endnode.  The Smart Endnode uses the nickname of the attached edge RBridge, so this solution does not consume extra nicknames.  The solution also enables endnodes that are Fine-Grained Label (FGL) aware."];

This document specifies a unique nickname approach.  This approach gives unique nicknames to all TRILL switches across the multilevel TRILL campus."];
