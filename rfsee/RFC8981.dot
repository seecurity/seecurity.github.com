VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a Virtual Router to one of the VRRP Routers on a LAN.  The VRRP Router controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a Virtual Router is called the Active Router, and it forwards packets routed to these IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  Active Routers are configured with virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and Backup Routers infer the address family of the virtual addresses being advertised based on the IP protocol version.  Within a VRRP Router, the Virtual Routers in each of the IPv4 and IPv6 address families are independent of one another and always treated as separate Virtual Router instances.  The election process provides dynamic failover in the forwarding responsibility should the Active Router become unavailable.  For IPv4, the advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher-availability default path without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.  For IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker switchover to Backup Routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery mechanisms."];

Partitioning as an Architecture for
Privacy

This document describes emerging patterns in protocols to partition what data and metadata is revealed through protocol interactions, provides common terminology, and discusses how to analyze such models."];

An Abstract Application Programming

This API enables faster deployment of new protocols and protocol features without requiring changes to the applications.  The specified API follows the Transport Services Architecture by providing asynchronous, atomic transmission of Messages.  It is intended to replace the BSD Socket API as the common interface to the transport layer, in an environment where endpoints could select from multiple network paths and potential transport protocols."];

State of Affairs for Randomized and

Addresses
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9724.html", target="_top", tooltip="Internet users are becoming more aware that their activity over the Internet leaves a vast digital footprint, that communications might not always be properly secured, and that their location and actions can be tracked. One of the main factors that eases tracking of Internet users is the wide use of long-lasting, and sometimes persistent, identifiers at various protocol layers. This document focuses on Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. There have been several initiatives within the IETF and the IEEE 802 standards committees to address some of the privacy issues involved. This document provides an overview of these activities to help coordinate standardization activities in these bodies."];

Randomized and Changing Media Access
Control (MAC) Addresses: Context,
Network Impacts, and Use Cases
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9797.html", target="_top", tooltip="To limit the privacy issues created by the association between a device, its traffic, its location, and its user in IEEE 802 networks, client vendors and client OS vendors have started implementing Media Access Control (MAC) address randomization. This technology is particularly important in Wi-Fi networks (defined in IEEE 802.11) due to the over-the-air medium and device mobility. When such randomization happens, some in-network states may break, which may affect network connectivity and user experience. At the same time, devices may continue using other stable identifiers, defeating the purpose of MAC address randomization. This document lists various network environments and a range of network services that may be affected by such randomization. This document then examines settings where the user experience may be affected by in-network state disruption. Last, this document examines some existing frameworks that maintain user privacy while preserving user quality of experience and network operation efficiency."];
