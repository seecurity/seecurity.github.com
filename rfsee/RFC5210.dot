A Source Address Validation Architecture
(SAVA) Testbed and Deployment Experience
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Because the Internet forwards packets according to the IP destination address, packet forwarding typically takes place without inspection of the source address and malicious attacks have been launched using spoofed source addresses.  In an effort to enhance the Internet with IP source address validation, a prototype implementation of the IP Source Address Validation Architecture (SAVA) was created and an evaluation was conducted on an IPv6 network.  This document reports on the prototype implementation and the test results, as well as the lessons and insights gained from experimentation.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating
Denial of Service Attacks which employ

2000", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC2827.html", target="_top", tooltip="This paper discusses a simple, effective, and straightforward method for using ingress traffic filtering to prohibit DoS (Denial of Service) attacks which use forged IP addresses to be propagated from 'behind' an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) aggregation point.

Ingress Filtering for Multihomed
Networks
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3704.html", target="_top", tooltip="BCP 38, RFC 2827, is designed to limit the impact of distributed denial of service attacks, by denying traffic with spoofed addresses access to the network, and to help ensure that traffic is traceable to its correct source network.  As a side effect of protecting the Internet against such attacks, the network implementing the solution also protects itself from this and other attacks, such as spoofed management access to networking equipment.  There are cases when this may create problems, e.g., with multihoming.  This document describes the current ingress filtering operational mechanisms, examines generic issues related to ingress filtering, and delves into the effects on multihoming in particular.  This memo updates RFC 2827.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
