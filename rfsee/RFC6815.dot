Applicability Statement for RFC 2544:
Use on Production Networks Considered
Harmful
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) has been developing key performance metrics and laboratory test methods since 1990, and continues this work at present.  The methods described in RFC 2544 are intended to generate traffic that overloads network device resources in order to assess their capacity.  Overload of shared resources would likely be harmful to user traffic performance on a production network, and there are further negative consequences identified with production application of the methods.  This memo clarifies the scope of RFC 2544 and other IETF BMWG benchmarking work for isolated test environments only, and it encourages new standards activity for measurement methods applicable outside that scope.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
