Protocol standard for a NetBIOS service
on a TCP/UDP transport: Concepts and
methods
1987", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This RFC defines a proposed standard protocol to support NetBIOS services in a TCP/IP environment.  Both local network and internet operation are supported.  Various node types are defined to accommodate local and internet topologies and to allow operation with or without the use of IP broadcast.  This RFC describes the NetBIOS-over-TCP protocols in a general manner, emphasizing the underlying ideas and techniques.  Detailed specifications are found in a companion RFC, Protocol Standard For a NetBIOS Service on a TCP/UDP Transport: Detailed Specifications.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Link-local Multicast Name Resolution
(LLMNR)
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4795.html", target="_top", tooltip="The goal of Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is to enable name resolution in scenarios in which conventional DNS name resolution is not possible.  LLMNR supports all current and future DNS formats, types, and classes, while operating on a separate port from DNS, and with a distinct resolver cache.  Since LLMNR only operates on the local link, it cannot be considered a substitute for DNS.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
