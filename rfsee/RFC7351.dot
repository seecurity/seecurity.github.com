An Extensible Markup Language (XML)
Patch Operations Framework Utilizing XML
Path Language (XPath) Selectors
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5261.html", target="_top", tooltip="Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents are widely used as containers for the exchange and storage of arbitrary data in today's systems.  In order to send changes to an XML document, an entire copy of the new version must be sent, unless there is a means of indicating only the portions that have changed.  This document describes an XML patch framework utilizing XML Path language (XPath) selectors.  These selector values and updated new data content constitute the basis of patch operations described in this document.  In addition to them, with basic &lt;add&gt;, &lt;replace&gt;, and &lt;remove&gt; directives a set of patches can then be applied to update an existing XML document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

There are a wide variety of Internet protocols being developed; many have need for a representation for structured data relevant to their application.  There has been much interest in the use of XML as a representation method.

Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
