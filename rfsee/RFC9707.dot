Report from the IAB Workshop on Barriers
to Internet Access of Services (BIAS)
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Barriers to Internet Access of Services (BIAS) workshop was
convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from January 15-17,
2024 as a three-day online meeting. Based on the submitted position
papers, the workshop covered three areas of interest: the role of
Community Networks in Internet access of services, reports and
comments on the observed digital divide, and measurements of
censorship and censorship circumvention. This report summarizes the
workshop's discussions and serves as a reference for reports on the
current barriers to Internet access. Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the
workshop. The views and positions documented in this report were
expressed during the workshop by participants and do not necessarily

Alternative Network Deployments:
Taxonomy, Characterization,
Technologies, and Architectures
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7962.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents a taxonomy of a set of Alternative Network Deployments that emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people or providing a local communication infrastructure to serve various complementary needs and objectives. They employ architectures and topologies different from those of mainstream networks and rely on alternative governance and business models. The document also surveys the technologies deployed in these networks, and their differing architectural characteristics, including a set of definitions and shared properties. The classification considers models such as Community Networks, Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs), networks owned by individuals but leased out to network operators who use them as a low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, networks that provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users, and rural utility cooperatives."];
