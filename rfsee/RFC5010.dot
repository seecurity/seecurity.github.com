Suboption

This information may be used by the DHCP server to better serve clients based on whether their request was originally broadcast or unicast.

DHCP Relay Agent Information Option

It is advantageous to use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) as defined in RFC 2131 to assign customer premise host IP addresses in this environment.  However, a number of security and scaling problems arise with such public DHCP use.  This document describes a new DHCP option to address these issues.  This option extends the set of DHCP options as defined in RFC 2132. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
