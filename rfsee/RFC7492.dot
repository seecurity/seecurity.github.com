Issues with Existing Cryptographic
Protection Methods for Routing Protocols
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6039.html", target="_top", tooltip="Routing protocols have been extended over time to use cryptographic mechanisms to ensure that data received from a neighboring router has not been modified in transit and actually originated from an authorized neighboring router. The cryptographic mechanisms defined to date and described in this document rely on a digest produced with a hash algorithm applied to the payload encapsulated in the routing protocol packet. This document outlines some of the limitations of the current mechanism, problems with manual keying of these cryptographic algorithms, and possible vectors for the exploitation of these limitations.

Instead, it defines the areas where protocol specification work is needed.  This document is a companion document to RFC 6518, Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP) Design Guidelines; together they form the guidance and instruction KARP design teams will use to review and overhaul routing protocol transport security."];
