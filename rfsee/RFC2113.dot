Quick-Start for TCP and IP

While Quick-Start is designed to be used by a range of transport protocols, in this document we only specify its use with TCP. Quick-Start is designed to allow connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers along the path approve the Quick-Start Request. This document describes many paths where Quick-Start Requests would not be approved. These paths include all paths containing routers, IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start. These paths also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing IP options. Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that include multi-access layer- two networks. This document also describes environments where the Quick-Start process could fail with false positives, with the sender incorrectly assuming that the Quick-Start Request had been approved by all of the routers along the path. As a result of these concerns, and as a result of the difficulties and seeming absence of motivation for routers, such as core routers to deploy Quick-Start, Quick-Start is being proposed as a mechanism that could be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet.

Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)

RSVP assumes that both the data sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling.

This document presents RSVP proxy behaviors allowing RSVP routers to initiate or terminate RSVP signaling on behalf of a receiver or a sender that is not RSVP-capable.  This allows resource reservations to be established on a critical subset of the end-to-end path.  This document reviews conceptual approaches for deploying RSVP proxies and discusses how RSVP reservations can be synchronized with application requirements, despite the sender, receiver, or both not participating in RSVP.  This document also points out where extensions to RSVP (or to other protocols) may be needed for deployment of a given RSVP proxy approach.

With conventional RSVP, both the data sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling.  Yet, there are many use cases where resource reservation is required, but the receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable.  Where the receiver is not RSVP- capable, an RSVP router may behave as an RSVP Receiver Proxy, thereby performing RSVP signaling on behalf of the receiver.  This allows resource reservations to be established on the segment of the end-to- end path from the sender to the RSVP Receiver Proxy.  However, as discussed in the companion document RSVP Proxy Approaches, RSVP extensions are needed to facilitate operations with an RSVP Receiver Proxy whose signaling is triggered by receipt of RSVP Path messages from the sender.

NSIS Operation over IP Tunnels
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5979.html", target="_top", tooltip="NSIS Quality of Service (QoS) signaling enables applications to perform QoS reservation along a data flow path.  When the data flow path contains IP tunnel segments, NSIS QoS signaling has no effect within those tunnel segments.  Therefore, the resulting tunnel segments could become the weakest QoS link and invalidate the QoS efforts in the rest of the end-to-end path.  The problem with NSIS signaling within the tunnel is caused by the tunnel encapsulation that masks packets' original IP header fields.  Those original IP header fields are needed to intercept NSIS signaling messages and classify QoS data packets.  This document defines a solution to this problem by mapping end-to-end QoS session requests to corresponding QoS sessions in the tunnel, thus extending the end-to-end QoS signaling into the IP tunnel segments.
