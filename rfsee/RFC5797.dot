FTP Command and Extension Registry
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Every version of the FTP specification has added a few new commands, with the early ones summarized in RFC 959.  RFC 2389 established a mechanism for specifying and negotiating FTP extensions.  The number of extensions, both those supported by the mechanism and some that are not, continues to increase.  An IANA registry of FTP Command and Feature names is established to reduce the likelihood of conflict of names and the consequent ambiguity.  This specification establishes that registry.

Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5226.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA. This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
