A Method for Generating Semantically
Opaque Interface Identifiers with IPv6
Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
(SLAAC)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7217.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a method for generating IPv6 Interface Identifiers to be used with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), such that an IPv6 address configured using this method is stable within each subnet, but the corresponding Interface Identifier changes when the host moves from one network to another.  This method is meant to be an alternative to generating Interface Identifiers based on hardware addresses (e.g., IEEE LAN Media Access Control (MAC) addresses), such that the benefits of stable addresses can be achieved without sacrificing the security and privacy of users.  The method specified in this document applies to all prefixes a host may be employing, including link-local, global, and unique-local prefixes (and their corresponding addresses)."];

Analysis of the 64-bit Boundary in IPv6
Addressing

Currently, the interface identifier is defined as 64 bits long for almost every case, leaving 64 bits for the subnet prefix.  This document describes the advantages of this fixed boundary and analyzes the issues that would be involved in treating it as a variable boundary."];
