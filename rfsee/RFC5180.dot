This document specifies a methodology for characterizing reset (and reset time) during benchmarking of forwarding devices and provides clarity and consistency in reset test procedures beyond what is specified in RFC 2544. Therefore, it updates RFC 2544. This document also defines the benchmarking term reset time and, only in this, updates RFC 1242.

Applicability Statement for RFC 2544:
Use on Production Networks Considered
Harmful

Overload of shared resources would likely be harmful to user traffic performance on a production network, and there are further negative consequences identified with production application of the methods.  This memo clarifies the scope of RFC 2544 and other IETF BMWG benchmarking work for isolated test environments only, and it encourages new standards activity for measurement methods applicable outside that scope.

However, none of them discuss how to apply pseudorandom port numbers from RFC 4814 to any stateful NATxy (such as NAT44, NAT64, and NAT66) technologies.  This document discusses why using pseudorandom port numbers with stateful NATxy gateways is a difficult problem.  It recommends a solution that limits the port number ranges and uses two test phases (phase 1 and phase 2).  This document shows how the classic performance measurement procedures (e.g., throughput, frame loss rate, latency, etc.) can be carried out.  New performance metrics and measurement procedures are also defined for measuring the maximum connection establishment rate, connection tear-down rate, and connection tracking table capacity."];
