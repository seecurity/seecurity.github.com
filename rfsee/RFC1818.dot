Clarifying when Standards Track
Documents may Refer Normatively to
Documents at a Lower Level
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3967.html", target="_top", tooltip="IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may not have a normative reference to another standards track document at a lower maturity level or to a non standards track specification (other than specifications from other standards bodies).  For example, a standards track document may not have a normative reference to an informational RFC.  Exceptions to this rule are sometimes needed as the IETF uses informational RFCs to describe non-IETF standards or IETF-specific modes of use of such standards.  This document clarifies and updates the procedure used in these circumstances.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
