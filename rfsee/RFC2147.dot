TCP and UDP over IPv6 Jumbograms
1997", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="IPv6 supports datagrams larger than 65535 bytes long, often referred to as jumbograms, through use of the Jumbo Payload hop-by-hop option.  The UDP protocol has a 16-bit length field that keeps it from being able to make use of jumbograms, and though TCP does not have a length field, both the MSS option and the Urgent field are constrained by 16-bits.  This document describes some simple changes that can be made to allow TCP and UDP to make use of IPv6 jumbograms. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Datagram Convergence Layers for the
Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant
Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol and
Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7122.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies the preferred method for transporting Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol data over the Internet using datagrams.  It covers convergence layers for the Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050), as well as the transportation of segments using the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) (RFC 5326).  UDP and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) are the candidate datagram protocols discussed.  UDP can only be used on a local network or in cases where the DTN node implements explicit congestion control.  DCCP addresses the congestion control problem, and its use is recommended whenever possible.  This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG) and represents the consensus of the DTNRG."];
