Domain Registry Grace Period Mapping for

Change Poll Extension for the Extensible

These operations may include contractual or policy requirements including, but not limited to, regular batch processes, customer support actions, Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) or Uniform Rapid Suspension (URS) actions, court-directed actions, and bulk updates based on customer requests.  Since the client is not directly involved or knowledgable of these operations, the extension is used along with an EPP object mapping to provide the resulting state of the postoperation object, and optionally a preoperation object, with the operation metadata of what, when, who, and why."];

Best Practices for Deletion of Domain

EPP also includes guidance for deletions that is intended to avoid DNS resolution disruptions and maintain data consistency.  However, operational relationships between objects can make that guidance difficult to implement.  Some EPP clients have developed operational practices to delete those objects that have unintended impacts on DNS resolution and security.  This document describes best current practices and proposes new potential practices to delete domain and host objects that reduce the risk of DNS resolution failure and maintain client-server data consistency."];
