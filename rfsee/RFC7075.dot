Realm-Based Redirection In Diameter
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Diameter protocol includes a capability for message redirection, controlled by an application-independent redirect agent. In some circumstances, an operator may wish to redirect messages to an alternate domain without specifying individual hosts. This document specifies an application-specific mechanism by which a Diameter server or proxy (node) can perform such a redirection when the Straightforward-Naming Authority Pointer (S-NAPTR) is not used for dynamic peer discovery. A node performing this new function is referred to as a Realm-based Redirect Server. This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC 6733 with respect to the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs).", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
