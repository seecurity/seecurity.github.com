TCP over Second (2.5G) and Third (3G)
Generation Wireless Networks

It then recommends TCP algorithm choices for nodes known to be starting or ending on such paths, and it also discusses open issues.  The configuration options recommended in this document are commonly found in modern TCP stacks, and are widely available standards-track mechanisms that the community considers safe for use on the general Internet.

The Eifel Detection Algorithm for TCP

It requires that the TCP Timestamps option defined in RFC 1323 be enabled for a connection.  The Eifel detection algorithm makes use of the fact that the TCP Timestamps option eliminates the retransmission ambiguity in TCP.  Based on the timestamp of the first acceptable ACK that arrives during loss recovery, it decides whether loss recovery was entered unnecessarily.  The Eifel detection algorithm provides a basis for future TCP enhancements.  This includes response algorithms to back out of loss recovery by restoring a TCP sender's congestion control state.
