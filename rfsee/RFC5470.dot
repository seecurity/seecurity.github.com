IMIX Genome: Specification of Variable

2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6985.html", target="_top", tooltip="Benchmarking methodologies have always relied on test conditions with constant packet sizes, with the goal of understanding what network device capability has been tested.  Tests with a constant packet size reveal device capabilities but differ significantly from the conditions encountered in operational deployment, so additional tests are sometimes conducted with a mixture of packet sizes, or IMIX (Internet Mix).  The mixture of sizes a networking device will encounter is highly variable and depends on many factors.  An IMIX suited for one networking device and deployment will not be appropriate for another.  However, the mix of sizes may be known, and the tester may be asked to augment the fixed-size tests.
