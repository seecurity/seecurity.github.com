HTTP Semantics

This document describes the overall architecture of HTTP, establishes common terminology, and defines aspects of the protocol that are shared by all versions. In this definition are core protocol elements, extensibility mechanisms, and the http and https Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes. This document updates RFC 3864 and obsoletes RFCs 2818, 7231, 7232, 7233, 7235, 7538, 7615, 7694, and portions of 7230."];

Extensible Prioritization Scheme for
HTTP
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9218.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a scheme that allows an HTTP client to communicate its preferences for how the upstream server prioritizes responses to its requests, and also allows a server to hint to a downstream intermediary how its responses should be prioritized when they are forwarded.  This document defines the Priority header field for communicating the initial priority in an HTTP version-independent manner, as well as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frames for reprioritizing responses.  These share a common format structure that is designed to provide future extensibility."];

Network Telemetry Framework

It encompasses various techniques for remote data generation, collection, correlation, and consumption.  This document describes an architectural framework for network telemetry, motivated by challenges that are encountered as part of the operation of networks and by the requirements that ensue.  This document clarifies the terminology and classifies the modules and components of a network telemetry system from different perspectives.  The framework and taxonomy help to set a common ground for the collection of related work and provide guidance for related technique and standard developments."];
