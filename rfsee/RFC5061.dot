IPsec Channels: Connection Latching

Connection latching can be used to protect applications against accidentally exposing live packet flows to unintended peers, whether as the result of a reconfiguration of IPsec or as the result of using weak peer identity to peer address associations. Weak association of peer ID and peer addresses is at the core of Better Than Nothing Security (BTNS); thus, connection latching can add a significant measure of protection to BTNS IPsec nodes. Finally, the availability of IPsec channels will make it possible to use channel binding to IPsec channels. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
