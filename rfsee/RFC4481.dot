Publication of Partial Presence
Information
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5264.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication describes a mechanism with which a presence user agent is able to publish presence information to a presence agent.  Using the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF), each presence publication contains full state, regardless of how much of that information has actually changed since the previous update.  As a consequence, updating a sizeable presence document with small changes bears a considerable overhead and is therefore inefficient.  Especially with low bandwidth and high latency links, this can constitute a considerable burden to the system.  This memo defines a solution that aids in reducing the impact of those constraints and increases transport efficiency by introducing a mechanism that allows for publication of partial presence information.
