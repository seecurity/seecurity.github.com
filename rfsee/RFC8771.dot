The Internationalized Deliberately

2020", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Domain Names were designed for humans, IP addresses were not.

This memo describes the Internationalized Deliberately Unreadable Network NOtation (I-DUNNO), a notation designed to replace current textual representations of IP addresses with something that is not only more concise but will also discourage this small, but obviously important, subset of human activity."];

This document defines a canonical textual representation format.  It does not define a format for internal storage, such as within an application or database.  It is expected that the canonical format will be followed by humans and systems when representing IPv6 addresses as text, but all implementations must accept and be able to handle any legitimate RFC 4291 format.

IANA Considerations for Three Letter
Acronyms
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5513.html", target="_top", tooltip="Three Letter Acronyms (TLAs) are commonly used to identify components of networks or protocols as designed or specified within the IETF. A common concern is that one acronym may have multiple expansions. While this may not have been an issue in the past, network convergence means that protocols that did not previously operate together are now found in close proximity. This results in contention for acronyms, and confusion in interpretation. Such confusion has the potential to degrade the performance of the Internet as misunderstandings lead to misconfiguration or other operating errors. Given the growing use of TLAs and the relatively small number available, this document specifies a Badly Construed Proposal (BCP) for the management of a registry of TLAs within the IETF, and the procedures for the allocation of new TLAs from the registry. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
