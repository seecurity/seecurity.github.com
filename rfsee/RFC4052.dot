Procedures for Handling Liaison

This procedure allows IETF to effectively collaborate with other organizations in the international standards community. The IETF expects that liaison statements might come from a variety of organizations, and it may choose to respond to many of those. The IETF is only obligated to respond if there is an agreed liaison relationship, however.

Procedures for Protocol Extensions and
Variations

Experience has shown that extension of protocols without early IETF review can carry risk. The document also recommends that major extensions to or variations of IETF protocols only take place through normal IETF processes or in coordination with the IETF. This document is directed principally at other Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) and vendors considering requirements for extensions to IETF protocols. It does not modify formal IETF processes. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
