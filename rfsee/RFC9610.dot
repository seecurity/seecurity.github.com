In contrast to the JSON-based jCard format, it is not a direct mapping from the vCard data model and expands semantics where appropriate.

This document defines a framework enabling application protocols to perform the preparation, enforcement, and comparison of internationalized strings (PRECIS) in a way that depends on the properties of Unicode code points and thus is more agile with respect to versions of Unicode.  As a result, this framework provides a more sustainable approach to the handling of internationalized strings than the previous framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454).
