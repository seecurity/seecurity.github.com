Supplemental Information for the New
Definition of the EF PHB (Expedited
Forwarding Per-Hop Behavior)
2002", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document was written during the process of clarification of RFC2598 An Expedited Forwarding PHB that led to the publication of revised specification of EF An Expedited Forwarding PHB.  Its primary motivation is providing additional explanation to the revised EF definition and its properties.  The document also provides additional implementation examples and gives some guidance for computation of the numerical parameters of the new definition for several well known schedulers and router architectures.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Implementing an Emergency
Telecommunications Service (ETS) for
Real-Time Services in the Internet
Protocol Suite
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4542.html", target="_top", tooltip="RFCs 3689 and 3690 detail requirements for an Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS), of which an Internet Emergency Preparedness Service (IEPS) would be a part. Some of these types of services require call preemption; others require call queuing or other mechanisms. IEPS requires a Call Admission Control (CAC) procedure and a Per Hop Behavior (PHB) for the data that meet the needs of this architecture. Such a CAC procedure and PHB is appropriate to any service that might use H.323 or SIP to set up real-time sessions. The key requirement is to guarantee an elevated probability of call completion to an authorized user in time of crisis. This document primarily discusses supporting ETS in the context of the US Government and NATO, because it focuses on the Multi-Level Precedence and Preemption (MLPP) and Government Emergency Telecommunication Service (GETS) standards. The architectures described here are applicable beyond these organizations. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

A Differentiated Services Code Point

This traffic is also admitted by the network using a Call Admission Control (CAC) procedure involving authentication, authorization, and capacity admission.
