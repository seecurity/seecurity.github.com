Guidelines for Cryptographic Key

This memo provides guidelines for making such decisions.  When symmetric cryptographic mechanisms are used in a protocol, the presumption is that automated key management is generally but not always needed.  If manual keying is proposed, the burden of proving that automated key management is not required falls to the proposer.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];

Synthetic Initialization Vector (SIV)
Authenticated Encryption Using the

SIV takes a key, a plaintext, and multiple variable-length octet strings that will be authenticated but not encrypted.  It produces a ciphertext having the same length as the plaintext and a synthetic initialization vector.  Depending on how it is used, SIV achieves either the goal of deterministic authenticated encryption or the goal of nonce-based, misuse-resistant authenticated encryption.
