RTP Payload Format for H.264 Video

The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer Units (NALUs), produced by an H.264 video encoder, in each RTP payload.  The payload format has wide applicability, as it supports applications from simple low bit-rate conversational usage, to Internet video streaming with interleaved transmission, to high bit-rate video-on-demand.

Signaling Media Decoding Dependency in
the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5583.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo defines semantics that allow for signaling the decoding dependency of different media descriptions with the same media type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP). This is required, for example, if media data is separated and transported in different network streams as a result of the use of a layered or multiple descriptive media coding process. A new grouping type DDP -- decoding dependency -- is defined, to be used in conjunction with RFC 3388 entitled Grouping of Media Lines in the Session Description Protocol. In addition, an attribute is specified describing the relationship of the media streams in a DDP group indicated by media identification attribute(s) and media format description(s).
