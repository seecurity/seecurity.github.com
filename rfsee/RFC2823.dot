PPP over Simple Data Link (SDL) using
SONET/SDH with ATM-like framing
2000", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document extends methods found in the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and RFCs 1662 and 2615 to include a new encapsulation for PPP called Simple Data Link (SDL).  SDL provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links, and RFCs 1662 and 2615 provide a means to carry PPP over Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) circuits.  SDL provides a very low overhead alternative to HDLC-like encapsulation, and can also be used on SONET/SDH links.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];
