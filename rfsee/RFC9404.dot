IMAP4 Non-synchronizing Literals
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7888.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet Message Access Protocol (RFC 3501) contains the literal syntactic construct for communicating strings. When sending a literal from client to server, IMAP requires the client to wait for the server to send a command continuation request between sending the octet count and the string data. This document specifies an alternate form of literal that does not require this network round trip. This document specifies 2 IMAP extensions: LITERAL+ and LITERAL-. LITERAL+ allows the alternate form of literals in all IMAP commands. LITERAL- is the same as LITERAL+, but it disallows the alternate form of literals unless they are 4096 bytes or less.

Instance Digests in HTTP
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3230.html", target="_top", tooltip="HTTP/1.1 defines a Content-MD5 header that allows a server to include a digest of the response body.  However, this is specifically defined to cover the body of the actual message, not the contents of the full file (which might be quite different, if the response is a Content-Range, or uses a delta encoding).  Also, the Content-MD5 is limited to one specific digest algorithm; other algorithms, such as SHA-1 (Secure Hash Standard), may be more appropriate in some circumstances.  Finally, HTTP/1.1 provides no explicit mechanism by which a client may request a digest.  This document proposes HTTP extensions that solve these problems. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Guidelines for Writing an IANA

To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.
