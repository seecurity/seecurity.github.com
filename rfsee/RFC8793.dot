Information-Centric Networking (ICN):
Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) and
Named Data Networking (NDN) Terminology

Named Data Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) are two prominent ICN architectures.  This document provides an overview of the terminology and definitions that have been used in describing concepts in these two implementations of ICN.  While there are other ICN architectures, they are not part of the NDN and CCNx concepts and as such are out of scope for this document.

Content-Centric Networking (CCNx)
Semantics
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8569.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the core concepts of the Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) architecture and presents a network protocol based on two messages: Interests and Content Objects. It specifies the set of mandatory and optional fields within those messages and describes their behavior and interpretation. This architecture and protocol specification is independent of a specific wire encoding. The protocol also uses a control message called an Interest Return, whereby one system can return an Interest message to the previous hop due to an error condition. This indicates to the previous hop that the current system will not respond to the Interest. This document is a product of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG). The document received wide review among ICNRG participants. Two full implementations are in active use and have informed the technical maturity of the protocol specification."];

This document describes an architecture that addresses a variety of problems with internetworks having operational and performance characteristics that make conventional (Internet-like) networking approaches either unworkable or impractical.  We define a message- oriented overlay that exists above the transport (or other) layers of the networks it interconnects.  The document presents a motivation for the architecture, an architectural overview, review of state management required for its operation, and a discussion of application design issues.  This document represents the consensus of the IRTF DTN research group and has been widely reviewed by that group.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
