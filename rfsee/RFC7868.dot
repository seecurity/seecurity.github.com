Cisco's Enhanced Interior Gateway
Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the protocol design and architecture for Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).  EIGRP is a routing protocol based on Distance Vector technology.  The specific algorithm used is called DUAL, a Diffusing Update Algorithm as referenced in Loop-Free Routing Using Diffusing Computations (Garcia-Luna-Aceves 1993).  The algorithm and procedures were researched, developed, and simulated by SRI International."];

Applicability of the Babel Routing
