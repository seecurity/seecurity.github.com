Benchmarking Terminology for Protection

The performance benchmarks are measured at the IP layer; protection may be provided at the sub-IP layer.  The benchmarks and terminology can be applied in methodology documents for different sub-IP layer protection mechanisms such as Automatic Protection Switching (APS), Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), Stateful High Availability (HA), and Multiprotocol Label Switching Fast Reroute (MPLS-FRR).
