Transport Layer Security over Stream
Control Transmission Protocol

The user of TLS can take advantage of the features provided by SCTP, namely the support of multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking and the support of multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance.  Additionally, discussions of extensions of SCTP are also supported, meaning especially the support of dynamic reconfiguration of IP- addresses. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

EAP-FAST is an EAP method that enables secure communication between a peer and a server by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually authenticated tunnel.  Within the tunnel, Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects are used to convey authentication related data between the peer and the EAP server.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
