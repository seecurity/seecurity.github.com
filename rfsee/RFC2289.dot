Security Mechanisms for the Internet
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3631.html", target="_top", tooltip="Security must be built into Internet Protocols for those protocols to offer their services securely.  Many security problems can be traced to improper implementations.  However, even a proper implementation will have security problems if the fundamental protocol is itself exploitable.  Exactly how security should be implemented in a protocol will vary, because of the structure of the protocol itself.  However, there are many protocols for which standard Internet security mechanisms, already developed, may be applicable.  The precise one that is appropriate in any given situation can vary.  We review a number of different choices, explaining the properties of each."];

Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP.  EAP provides its own support for duplicate elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees.  Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual EAP methods may support this.  This document obsoletes RFC 2284.
