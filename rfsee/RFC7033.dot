CUSAX: Combined Use of the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
Extensible Messaging and Presence
Protocol (XMPP)
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7081.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document suggests some strategies for the combined use of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) both in user-oriented clients and in deployed servers.  Such strategies, which mainly consist of configuration changes and minimal software modifications to existing clients and servers, aim to provide a single, full-featured, real-time communication service by using complementary subsets of features from SIP and from XMPP.  Typically, such subsets consist of telephony capabilities from SIP and instant messaging and presence capabilities from XMPP.  This document does not define any new protocols or syntax for either SIP or XMPP and, by intent, does not attempt to standardize best current practices.  Instead, it merely aims to provide practical guidance to those who are interested in the combined use of SIP and XMPP for real-time communication."];

A Set of Simple Authentication and
Security Layer (SASL) Mechanisms for
OAuth
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7628.html", target="_top", tooltip="OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to a protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf. This document defines how an application client uses credentials obtained via OAuth over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) to access a protected resource at a resource server. Thereby, it enables schemes defined within the OAuth framework for non-HTTP-based application protocols. Clients typically store the user's long-term credential. This does, however, lead to significant security vulnerabilities, for example, when such a credential leaks. A significant benefit of OAuth for usage in those clients is that the password is replaced by a shared secret with higher entropy, i.e., the token. Tokens typically provide limited access rights and can be managed and revoked separately from the user's long-term password."];
