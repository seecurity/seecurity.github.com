NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP)
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a protocol for automating the process of creating Network Address Translation (NAT) port mappings.  Included in the protocol is a method for retrieving the external IPv4 address of a NAT gateway, thus allowing a client to make its external IPv4 address and port known to peers that may wish to communicate with it.  From 2005 onwards, this protocol was implemented in Apple products including Mac OS X, Bonjour for Windows, and AirPort wireless base stations.  In 2013, NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP) was superseded by the IETF Standards Track RFC Port Control Protocol (PCP), which builds on NAT-PMP and uses a compatible packet format, but adds a number of significant enhancements."];

IAB Considerations for UNilateral Self-

Address Translation
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3424.html", target="_top", tooltip="As a result of the nature of Network Address Translation (NAT) Middleboxes, communicating endpoints that are separated by one or more NATs do not know how to refer to themselves using addresses that are valid in the addressing realms of their (current and future) peers.  Various proposals have been made for UNilateral Self-Address Fixing (UNSAF) processes.  These are processes whereby some originating endpoint attempts to determine or fix the address (and port) by which it is known to another endpoint - e.g., to be able to use address data in the protocol exchange, or to advertise a public address from which it will receive connections.  This document outlines the reasons for which these proposals can be considered at best as short term fixes to specific problems and the specific issues to be carefully evaluated before creating an UNSAF proposal.
