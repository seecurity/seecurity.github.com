While Quick-Start is designed to be used by a range of transport protocols, in this document we only specify its use with TCP. Quick-Start is designed to allow connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers along the path approve the Quick-Start Request. This document describes many paths where Quick-Start Requests would not be approved. These paths include all paths containing routers, IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start. These paths also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing IP options. Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that include multi-access layer- two networks. This document also describes environments where the Quick-Start process could fail with false positives, with the sender incorrectly assuming that the Quick-Start Request had been approved by all of the routers along the path. As a result of these concerns, and as a result of the difficulties and seeming absence of motivation for routers, such as core routers to deploy Quick-Start, Quick-Start is being proposed as a mechanism that could be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet.

Using Device-Provided Location-Related
Measurements in Location Configuration
Protocols
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7105.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a protocol for a Device to provide location-related measurement data to a Location Information Server (LIS) within a request for location information.  Location-related measurement information provides observations concerning properties related to the position of a Device; this information could be data about network attachment or about the physical environment.  A LIS is able to use the location-related measurement data to improve the accuracy of the location estimate it provides to the Device.  A basic set of location-related measurements are defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters."];

Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation for Data
Frames in Control and Provisioning of
Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8350.html", target="_top", tooltip="Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) is a protocol for encapsulating a station's data frames between the Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller (AC).  Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data frames can be either locally bridged or tunneled to the AC.  When tunneled, a CAPWAP Data Channel is used for tunneling.  In many deployments, encapsulating data frames to an entity other than the AC (for example, to an Access Router (AR)) is desirable.  Furthermore, it may also be desirable to use different tunnel encapsulation modes between the WTP and the Access Router.  This document defines an extension to the CAPWAP protocol that supports this capability and refers to it as alternate tunnel encapsulation.  The alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint different from the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many known encapsulation types, such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, or CAPWAP.  The WTP may advertise support for alternate tunnel encapsulation during the discovery and join process, and the AC may select one of the supported alternate tunnel encapsulation types while configuring the WTP."];

A YANG Data Model for Tunnel Interface
Types
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8675.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies the initial version of a YANG module iana-tunnel-type, which contains a collection of IANA-maintained YANG identities used as interface types for tunnel interfaces. The module reflects the tunnelType registry maintained by IANA. The latest revision of this YANG module can be obtained from the IANA website. Tunnel type values are not directly added to the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module; they must instead be added to the tunnelType IANA registry. Once a new tunnel type registration is made by IANA for a new tunneling scheme or even an existing one that is not already listed in the current registry (e.g., LISP, NSH), IANA will update the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module accordingly. Some of the IETF-defined tunneling techniques are not listed in the current IANA registry. It is not the intent of this document to update the existing IANA registry with a comprehensive list of tunnel technologies. Registrants must follow the IETF registration procedure for interface types whenever a new tunnel type is needed."];

Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS) for such a BNG improves flexibility and scalability but requires various communication between the User Plane (UP) and the Control Plane (CP). China Mobile, Huawei Technologies, and ZTE have developed a simple CUPS control channel protocol to support such communication: the Simple Control and User Plane Separation Protocol (S-CUSP). S-CUSP is defined in this document. This document is not an IETF standard and does not have IETF consensus.

Guidelines for Adding Congestion
Notification to Protocols that
Encapsulate IP
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9599.html", target="_top", tooltip="The purpose of this document is to guide the design of congestion notification in any lower-layer or tunnelling protocol that encapsulates IP.  The aim is for explicit congestion signals to propagate consistently from lower-layer protocols into IP.  Then, the IP internetwork layer can act as a portability layer to carry congestion notification from non-IP-aware congested nodes up to the transport layer (L4).  Specifications that follow these guidelines, whether produced by the IETF or other standards bodies, should assure interworking among IP-layer and lower-layer congestion notification mechanisms.  This document is included in BCP 89 and updates the single paragraph of advice to subnetwork designers about Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in Section 13 of RFC 3819 by replacing it with a reference to this document."];

Propagating Explicit Congestion
Notification across IP Tunnel Headers

It surveys widely deployed IP tunnelling protocols that use such shim headers and updates the specifications of those that do not mention ECN propagation (including RFCs 2661, 3931, 2784, 4380 and 7450, which specify L2TPv2, L2TPv3, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), Teredo, and Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT), respectively).
