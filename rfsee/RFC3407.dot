Security Descriptions for Media Streams

The attribute describes a cryptographic key and other parameters that serve to configure security for a unicast media stream in either a single message or a roundtrip exchange.  The attribute can be used with a variety of SDP media transports, and this document defines how to use it for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) unicast media streams.  The SDP crypto attribute requires the services of a data security protocol to secure the SDP message. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The package allows for fax calls to be supported in two different ways.  The first one utilizes ITU-T Recommendation T.38 for fax relay under the control of the Call Agent.  The second one lets the gateway decide upon a method for fax transmission as well as handle the details of the fax call without Call Agent involvement.

Session Description Protocol (SDP)
Capability Negotiation
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5939.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended to describe multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation. SDP was not intended to provide capability indication or capability negotiation; however, over the years, SDP has seen widespread adoption and as a result it has been gradually extended to provide limited support for these, notably in the form of the offer/answer model defined in RFC 3264. SDP does not define how to negotiate one or more alternative transport protocols (e.g., RTP profiles) or attributes. This makes it difficult to deploy new RTP profiles such as Secure RTP or RTP with RTCP-based feedback, negotiate use of different security keying mechanisms, etc. It also presents problems for some forms of media negotiation. The purpose of this document is to address these shortcomings by extending SDP with capability negotiation parameters and associated offer/answer procedures to use those parameters in a backwards compatible manner. The document defines a general SDP Capability Negotiation framework. It also specifies how to provide attributes and transport protocols as capabilities and negotiate them using the framework. Extensions for other types of capabilities (e.g., media types and media formats) may be provided in other documents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
