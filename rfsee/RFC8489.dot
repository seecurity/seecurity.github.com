Architecture and Requirements for
Transport Services

The Transport Services Application Programming Interface (API) is based on an asynchronous, event-driven interaction pattern.  This API uses Messages for representing data transfer to applications and describes how a Transport Services Implementation can use multiple IP addresses, multiple protocols, and multiple paths and can provide multiple application streams.  This document provides the architecture and requirements.  It defines common terminology and concepts to be used in definitions of a Transport Services API and a Transport Services Implementation."];

An Abstract Application Programming
Interface (API) for Transport Services

This API enables faster deployment of new protocols and protocol features without requiring changes to the applications.  The specified API follows the Transport Services Architecture by providing asynchronous, atomic transmission of Messages.  It is intended to replace the BSD Socket API as the common interface to the transport layer, in an environment where endpoints could select from multiple network paths and potential transport protocols."];
