Protocol standard for a NetBIOS service

specifications
1987", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This RFC defines a proposed standard protocol to support NetBIOS services in a TCP/IP environment.  Both local network and internet operation are supported.  Various node types are defined to accommodate local and internet topologies and to allow operation with or without the use of IP broadcast.  This RFC gives the detailed specifications of the netBIOS-over-TCP packets, protocols, and defined constants and variables.  A more general overview is found in a companion RFC, Protocol Standard For NetBIOS Service on TCP/UDP Transport: Concepts and Methods.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Current Hostname Practice Considered
Harmful
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8117.html", target="_top", tooltip="Giving a hostname to your computer and publishing it as you roam from one network to another is the Internet's equivalent of walking around with a name tag affixed to your lapel. This current practice can significantly compromise your privacy, and something should change in order to mitigate these privacy threats. There are several possible remedies, such as fixing a variety of protocols or avoiding disclosing a hostname at all. This document describes some of the protocols that reveal hostnames today and sketches another possible remedy, which is to replace static hostnames by frequently changing randomized values."];

Statement
