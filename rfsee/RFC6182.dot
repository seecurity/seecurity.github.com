Architectural Guidelines for Multipath
TCP Development
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Hosts are often connected by multiple paths, but TCP restricts communications to a single path per transport connection. Resource usage within the network would be more efficient were these multiple paths able to be used concurrently. This should enhance user experience through improved resilience to network failure and higher throughput. This document outlines architectural guidelines for the development of a Multipath Transport Protocol, with references to how these architectural components come together in the development of a Multipath TCP (MPTCP). This document lists certain high-level design decisions that provide foundations for the design of the MPTCP protocol, based upon these architectural requirements.

Hierarchical IPv4 Framework
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6306.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a framework for how the current IPv4 address space can be divided into two new address categories: a core address space (Area Locators, ALOCs) that is globally unique, and an edge address space (Endpoint Locators, ELOCs) that is regionally unique. In the future, the ELOC space will only be significant in a private network or in a service provider domain. Therefore, a 32x32 bit addressing scheme and a hierarchical routing architecture are achieved. The hierarchical IPv4 framework is backwards compatible with the current IPv4 Internet. This document also discusses a method for decoupling the location and identifier functions -- future applications can make use of the separation. The framework requires extensions to the existing Domain Name System (DNS), the existing IPv4 stack of the endpoints, middleboxes, and routers in the Internet. The framework can be implemented incrementally for endpoints, DNS, middleboxes, and routers. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Multiple Interfaces and Provisioning
Domains Problem Statement
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6418.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes issues encountered by a node attached to multiple provisioning domains.  This node receives configuration information from each of its provisioning domains, where some configuration objects are global to the node and others are local to the interface.  Issues such as selecting the wrong interface to send traffic happen when conflicting node-scoped configuration objects are received and inappropriately used.  Moreover, other issues are the result of simultaneous attachment to multiple networks, such as domain selection or addressing and naming space overlaps, regardless of the provisioning mechanism.  While multiple provisioning domains are typically seen on nodes with multiple interfaces, this document also discusses situations involving single-interface nodes.

The framework defines the concept of a Provisioning Domain (PvD), which is a consistent set of network configuration information.  PvD-aware nodes learn PvD-specific information from the networks they are attached to and/or other sources.  PvDs are used to enable separation and configuration consistency in the presence of multiple concurrent connections."];

TCP Extensions for Multipath Operation
with Multiple Addresses
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8684.html", target="_top", tooltip="TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers. The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and thus improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure. Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., a reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths. This document specifies v1 of Multipath TCP, obsoleting v0 as specified in RFC 6824, through clarifications and modifications primarily driven by deployment experience."];

Requirements for Time-Based Loss
Detection
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8961.html", target="_top", tooltip="Many protocols must detect packet loss for various reasons (e.g., to ensure reliability using retransmissions or to understand the level of congestion along a network path).  While many mechanisms have been designed to detect loss, ultimately, protocols can only count on the passage of time without delivery confirmation to declare a packet lost.  Each implementation of a time-based loss detection mechanism represents a balance between correctness and timeliness; therefore, no implementation suits all situations.  This document provides high-level requirements for time-based loss detectors appropriate for general use in unicast communication across the Internet.  Within the requirements, implementations have latitude to define particulars that best address each situation."];
