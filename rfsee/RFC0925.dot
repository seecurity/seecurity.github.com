Multi-LAN address resolution
1984", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The problem of treating a set of local area networks (LANs) as one Internet network has generated some interest and concern.  It is inappropriate to give each LAN within an site a distinct Internet network number.  It is desirable to hide the details of the interconnections between the LANs within an site from people, gateways, and hosts outside the site.  The question arises on how to best do this, and even how to do it at all.  In RFC-917 Jeffery Mogul makes a case for the use of explicit subnets in a multi-LAN environment.  The explicit subnet scheme is a call to recursively apply the mechanisms the Internet uses to manage networks to the problem of managing LANs within one network.  In this note I urge another approach: the use of transparent subnets supported by a multi-LAN extension of the Address Resolution Protocol.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
