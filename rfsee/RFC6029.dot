A Survey on Research on the Application-
Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
Problem
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used originally for file sharing, and more recently for real-time communications and live media streaming.  Such applications discover a route to each other through an overlay network with little knowledge of the underlying network topology.  As a result, they may choose peers based on information deduced from empirical measurements, which can lead to suboptimal choices.  This document, a product of the P2P Research Group, presents a survey of existing literature on discovering and using network topology information for Application-Layer Traffic Optimization.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
(ALTO) Problem Statement
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5693.html", target="_top", tooltip="Distributed applications -- such as file sharing, real-time communication, and live and on-demand media streaming -- prevalent on the Internet use a significant amount of network resources. Such applications often transfer large amounts of data through connections established between nodes distributed across the Internet with little knowledge of the underlying network topology. Some applications are so designed that they choose a random subset of peers from a larger set with which to exchange data. Absent any topology information guiding such choices, or acting on suboptimal or local information obtained from measurements and statistics, these applications often make less than desirable choices. This document discusses issues related to an information-sharing service that enables applications to perform better-than-random peer selection. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Survey of Research towards Robust Peer-
to-Peer Networks: Search Methods
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4981.html", target="_top", tooltip="The pace of research on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking in the last five years warrants a critical survey. P2P has the makings of a disruptive technology -- it can aggregate enormous storage and processing resources while minimizing entry and scaling costs. Failures are common amongst massive numbers of distributed peers, though the impact of individual failures may be less than in conventional architectures. Thus, the key to realizing P2P's potential in applications other than casual file sharing is robustness. P2P search methods are first couched within an overall P2P taxonomy. P2P indexes for simple key lookup are assessed, including those based on Plaxton trees, rings, tori, butterflies, de Bruijn graphs, and skip graphs. Similarly, P2P indexes for keyword lookup, information retrieval and data management are explored. Finally, early efforts to optimize range, multi-attribute, join, and aggregation queries over P2P indexes are reviewed. Insofar as they are available in the primary literature, robustness mechanisms and metrics are highlighted throughout. However, the low-level mechanisms that most affect robustness are not well isolated in the literature. Recommendations are given for future research.

Report from the IETF Workshop on Peer-

2008

The workshop was held on May 28, 2008 at MIT in Cambridge, MA, USA.  The goals of the workshop were twofold: to understand the technical problems that ISPs and end users are experiencing as a result of high volumes of P2P traffic, and to begin to understand how the IETF may be helpful in addressing these problems.  Gaining an understanding of where in the IETF this work might be pursued and how to extract feasible work items were highlighted as important tasks in pursuit of the latter goal.  The workshop was very well attended and produced several work items that have since been taken up by members of the IETF community.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
