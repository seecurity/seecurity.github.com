The Quantum Bug
2020", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The age of quantum networking is upon us, and with it comes entanglement: a procedure in which a state (i.e., a bit) can be transferred instantly, with no measurable delay between peers.  This will lead to a perceived round-trip time of zero seconds on some Internet paths, a capability which was not predicted and so not included as a possibility in many protocol specifications.  Worse than the millennium bug, this unexpected value is bound to cause serious Internet failures unless the specifications are fixed in time."];

Design Considerations for Faster-Than-
Light (FTL) Communication
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6921.html", target="_top", tooltip="We are approaching the time when we will be able to communicate faster than the speed of light.  It is well known that as we approach the speed of light, time slows down.  Logically, it is reasonable to assume that as we go faster than the speed of light, time will reverse.  The major consequence of this for Internet protocols is that packets will arrive before they are sent.  This will have a major impact on the way we design Internet protocols.  This paper outlines some of the issues and suggests some directions for additional analysis of these issues."];

TCP Fast Open
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7413.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes an experimental TCP mechanism called TCP Fast Open (TFO).  TFO allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake, and saves up to one full round-trip time (RTT) compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged.  However, TFO deviates from the standard TCP semantics, since the data in the SYN could be replayed to an application in some rare circumstances.  Applications should not use TFO unless they can tolerate this issue, as detailed in the Applicability section."];

Low Extra Delay Background Transport
(LEDBAT)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6817.html", target="_top", tooltip="Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) is an experimental delay-based congestion control algorithm that seeks to utilize the available bandwidth on an end-to-end path while limiting the consequent increase in queueing delay on that path.  LEDBAT uses changes in one-way delay measurements to limit congestion that the flow itself induces in the network.  LEDBAT is designed for use by background bulk-transfer applications to be no more aggressive than standard TCP congestion control (as specified in RFC 5681) and to yield in the presence of competing flows, thus limiting interference with the network performance of competing flows.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Coupled Congestion Control for Multipath
Transport Protocols
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6356.html", target="_top", tooltip="Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but communications are usually restricted to a single path per connection. Resource usage within the network would be more efficient were it possible for these multiple paths to be used concurrently. Multipath TCP is a proposal to achieve multipath transport in TCP. New congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms have a series of issues in the multipath context. One of the prominent problems is that running existing algorithms such as standard TCP independently on each path would give the multipath flow more than its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its subflows. Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths available will transfer more traffic using the least congested of the paths, achieving a property called resource pooling where a bundle of links effectively behaves like one shared link with bigger capacity. This would increase the overall efficiency of the network and also its robustness to failure. This document presents a congestion control algorithm that couples the congestion control algorithms running on different subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the overall aggressiveness of the multipath flow. The result is a practical algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested links. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Multimedia Congestion Control: Circuit
Breakers for Unicast RTP Sessions
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8083.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony, video conferencing, and telepresence applications. Such applications are often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks. If congestion control is not implemented in these applications, then network congestion can lead to uncontrolled packet loss and a resulting deterioration of the user's multimedia experience. The congestion control algorithm acts as a safety measure by stopping RTP flows from using excessive resources and protecting the network from overload. At the time of this writing, however, while there are several proprietary solutions, there is no standard algorithm for congestion control of interactive RTP flows. This document does not propose a congestion control algorithm. It instead defines a minimal set of RTP circuit breakers: conditions under which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data to protect the network from excessive congestion. It is expected that, in the absence of long-lived excessive congestion, RTP applications running on best-effort IP networks will be able to operate without triggering these circuit breakers. To avoid triggering the RTP circuit breaker, any Standards Track congestion control algorithms defined for RTP will need to operate within the envelope set by these RTP circuit breaker algorithms."];

The Internet and the Millennium Problem

This investigation only targeted the protocols as documented in the Request For Comments Series (RFCs).  This investigation discovered little reason for concern with regards to the functionality of the protocols.  A few minor cases of older implementations still using two digit years (ala RFC 850) were discovered, but almost all Internet protocols were given a clean bill of health.  Several cases of period problems were discovered, where a time field would roll over as the size of field was reached.  In particular, there are several protocols, which have 32 bit, signed integer representations of the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 which will turn negative at Tue Jan 19 03:14:07 GMT 2038.  Areas whose protocols will be effected by such problems have been notified so that new revisions will remove this limitation.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
