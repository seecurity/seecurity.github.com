An Optimization for the Mobile Ad Hoc
Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery
Protocol (NHDP)
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The link quality mechanism of the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) enables ignoring some 1-hop neighbors if the measured link quality from that 1-hop neighbor is below an acceptable threshold while still retaining the corresponding link information as acquired from the HELLO message exchange. This allows immediate reinstatement of the 1-hop neighbor if the link quality later improves sufficiently. NHDP also collects information about symmetric 2-hop neighbors. However, it specifies that if a link from a symmetric 1-hop neighbor ceases being symmetric, including while ignored (as described above), then corresponding symmetric 2-hop neighbors are removed. This may lead to symmetric 2-hop neighborhood information being permanently removed (until further HELLO messages are received) if the link quality of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable threshold, even if only for a moment. This specification updates RFC 6130 Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) and RFC 7181 The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2) to permit, as an option, retaining, but ignoring, symmetric 2-hop information when the link quality from the corresponding 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable threshold. This allows immediate reinstatement of the symmetric 2-hop neighbor if the link quality later improves sufficiently, thus making the symmetric 2-hop neighborhood more robust.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

The extensions described in this document add objects and values to support the NHDP optimization specified in RFC 7466.
