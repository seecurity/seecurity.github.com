Sockets Application Program Interface
(API) for Multihoming Shim
2011", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies sockets API extensions for the multihoming shim layer. The API aims to enable interactions between applications and the multihoming shim layer for advanced locator management, and access to information about failure detection and path exploration. This document is based on an assumption that a multihomed host is equipped with a conceptual sub-layer (hereafter called shim sub- layer) inside the IP layer that maintains mappings between identifiers and locators. Examples of the shim are Shim6 and the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Shim6: Level 3 Multihoming Shim Protocol

The hosts in a site that has multiple provider- allocated IPv6 address prefixes will use the Shim6 protocol specified in this document to set up state with peer hosts so that the state can later be used to failover to a different locator pair, should the original one stop working.

Hash-Based Addresses (HBA)
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5535.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo describes a mechanism to provide a secure binding between the multiple addresses with different prefixes available to a host within a multihomed site.  This mechanism employs either Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) or a new variant of the same theme that uses the same format in the addresses.  The main idea in the new variant is that information about the multiple prefixes is included within the addresses themselves.  This is achieved by generating the interface identifiers of the addresses of a host as hashes of the available prefixes and a random number.  Then, the multiple addresses are generated by prepending the different prefixes to the generated interface identifiers.  The result is a set of addresses, called Hash-Based Addresses (HBAs), that are inherently bound to each other. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The expected applications include Ping, Traceroute, routing daemons and the like, which typically use raw sockets to access IPv6 or ICMPv6 header fields.  This document proposes some portable interfaces for applications that use raw sockets under IPv6.  There are other features of IPv6 that some applications will need to access: interface identification (specifying the outgoing interface and determining the incoming interface), IPv6 extension headers, and path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) information.  This document provides API access to these features too.  Additionally, some extended interfaces to libraries for the r commands are defined.
