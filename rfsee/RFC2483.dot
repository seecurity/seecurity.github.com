URI Resolution Services Necessary for
URN Resolution
1999", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Retrieving the resource identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is only one of the operations that can be performed on a URI.  One might also ask for and get a list of other identifiers that are aliases for the original URI or a bibliographic description of the resource the URI denotes, for example.  This applies to both Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).  Uniform Resource Characteristics (URCs) are discussed in this document but only as descriptions of resources rather than identifiers.

Media Resource Control Protocol Version
2 (MRCPv2)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6787.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) allows client hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers, recognizers, verifiers, and identifiers residing in servers on the network.  MRCPv2 is not a stand-alone protocol -- it relies on other protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe, discover, and exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the media source or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above, allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the speech resource server.

Uniform Resource Names (URNs)
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8141.html", target="_top", tooltip="A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is assigned under the urn URI scheme and a particular URN namespace, with the intent that the URN will be a persistent, location-independent resource identifier.  With regard to URN syntax, this document defines the canonical syntax for URNs (in a way that is consistent with URI syntax), specifies methods for determining URN-equivalence, and discusses URI conformance.  With regard to URN namespaces, this document specifies a method for defining a URN namespace and associating it with a namespace identifier, and it describes procedures for registering namespace identifiers with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  This document obsoletes both RFCs 2141 and 3406."];
