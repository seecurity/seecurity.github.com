RIB Information Model
2018", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Routing and routing functions in enterprise and carrier networks are typically performed by network devices (routers and switches) using a Routing Information Base (RIB).  Protocols and configurations push data into the RIB, and the RIB manager installs state into the hardware for packet forwarding.  This document specifies an information model for the RIB to enable defining a standardized data model.  The IETF's I2RS WG used this document to design the I2RS RIB data model.  This document is being published to record the higher- level information model decisions for RIBs so that other developers of RIBs may benefit from the design concepts.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Problem Statement for the Interface to
the Routing System
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7920.html", target="_top", tooltip="Traditionally, routing systems have implemented routing and signaling (e.g., MPLS) to control traffic forwarding in a network. Route computation has been controlled by relatively static policies that define link cost, route cost, or import and export routing policies. Requirements have emerged to more dynamically manage and program routing systems due to the advent of highly dynamic data-center networking, on-demand WAN services, dynamic policy-driven traffic steering and service chaining, the need for real-time security threat responsiveness via traffic control, and a paradigm of separating policy-based decision-making from the router itself. These requirements should allow controlling routing information and traffic paths and extracting network topology information, traffic statistics, and other network analytics from routing systems. This document proposes meeting this need via an Interface to the Routing System (I2RS)."];

Routing Backus-Naur Form (RBNF): A

However, there is no formal definition of this version of BNF. There is value in using the same variant of BNF for the set of protocols that are commonly used together. This reduces confusion and simplifies implementation. Updating existing documents to use some other variant of BNF that is already formally documented would be a substantial piece of work. This document provides a formal definition of the variant of BNF that has been used (that we call Routing BNF) and makes it available for use by new protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
