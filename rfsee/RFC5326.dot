Licklider Transmission Protocol -
Specification
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), designed to provide retransmission-based reliability over links characterized by extremely long message round-trip times (RTTs) and/or frequent interruptions in connectivity. Since communication across interplanetary space is the most prominent example of this sort of environment, LTP is principally aimed at supporting long-haul reliable transmission in interplanetary space, but it has applications in other environments as well. This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.

Delay-Tolerant Networking Bundle
Protocol IANA Registries

The specifications of these protocols contain fields that are subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the group created ad hoc registries.  As the specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.

Using Self-Delimiting Numeric Values in
Protocols
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6256.html", target="_top", tooltip="Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) have recently been introduced as a field type in proposed Delay-Tolerant Networking protocols.  SDNVs encode an arbitrary-length non-negative integer or arbitrary- length bitstring with minimum overhead.  They are intended to provide protocol flexibility without sacrificing economy and to assist in future-proofing protocols under development.  This document describes formats and algorithms for SDNV encoding and decoding, along with notes on implementation and usage.

Datagram Convergence Layers for the

Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7122.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies the preferred method for transporting Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol data over the Internet using datagrams.  It covers convergence layers for the Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050), as well as the transportation of segments using the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) (RFC 5326).  UDP and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) are the candidate datagram protocols discussed.  UDP can only be used on a local network or in cases where the DTN node implements explicit congestion control.  DCCP addresses the congestion control problem, and its use is recommended whenever possible.  This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG) and represents the consensus of the DTNRG."];

Evaluation of a Sample of RFCs Produced
in 2018
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8963.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents the author's effort to understand the delays involved in publishing an idea in the IETF or through the Independent Stream, from the first individual draft to the publication of the RFC. We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFCs approved in 2018, looking for history and delays. We also use two randomly chosen sets of RFCs published in 2008 and 1998 for comparing delays seen in 2018 to those observed 10 or 20 years ago. The average RFC in the 2018 sample was produced in 3 years and 4 months, of which 2 years and 10 months were spent in the working group, 3 to 4 months for IETF consensus and IESG review, and 3 to 4 months in RFC production. The main variation in RFC production delays comes from the AUTH48 phase. We also measure the number of citations of the chosen RFC using Semantic Scholar, and compare citation counts with what we know about deployment. We show that citation counts indicate academic interest, but correlate only loosely with deployment or usage of the specifications. Counting web references could complement that."];
