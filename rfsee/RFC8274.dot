Incident Object Description Exchange
Format Usage Guidance
2017", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) v2 (RFC7970) defines a data representation that provides a framework for sharing information about computer security incidents commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) .  Since the IODEF model includes a wealth of available options that can be used to describe a security incident or issue, it can be challenging for security practitioners to develop tools that leverage IODEF for incident sharing.  This document provides guidelines for IODEF implementers.  It addresses how common security indicators can be represented in IODEF and use-cases of how IODEF is being used.  This document aims to make IODEF's adoption by vendors easier and encourage faster and wider adoption of the model by CSIRTs around the world."];

Enumeration Reference Format for the
Incident Object Description Exchange
Format (IODEF)
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7495.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) is an XML data representation framework for sharing information about computer security incidents. In IODEF, the Reference class provides references to externally specified information such as a vulnerability, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alert, malware sample, advisory, or attack technique. In practice, these references are based on external enumeration specifications that define both the enumeration format and the specific enumeration values, but the IODEF Reference class (as specified in IODEF v1 in RFC 5070) does not indicate how to include both of these important pieces of information. This document establishes a stand-alone data format to include both the external specification and specific enumeration identification value, and establishes an IANA registry to manage external enumeration specifications. While this document does not update IODEF v1, this enumeration reference format is used in IODEF v2 and is applicable to other formats that support this class of enumeration references."];

Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID)

Service providers and Computer Security Incident Response Teams need to be equipped and ready to assist in communicating and tracing security incidents with tools and procedures in place before the occurrence of an attack.  Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) outlines a proactive inter-network communication method to facilitate sharing incident-handling data while integrating existing detection, tracing, source identification, and mitigation mechanisms for a complete incident-handling solution.  Combining these capabilities in a communication system provides a way to achieve higher security levels on networks.  Policy guidelines for handling incidents are recommended and can be agreed upon by a consortium using the security recommendations and considerations.  This document obsoletes RFC 6045.
