The current work in IETF working groups shows these logical entities, but it does not address the physical decomposition and the protocol between the entities.

Media Control Channel Framework
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6230.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a framework and protocol for application deployment where the application programming logic and media processing are distributed. This implies that application programming logic can seamlessly gain access to appropriate resources that are not co-located on the same physical network entity. The framework uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish an application-level control mechanism between application servers and associated external servers such as media servers. The motivation for the creation of this framework is to provide an interface suitable to meet the requirements of a centralized conference system, where the conference system can be distributed, as defined by the XCON working group in the IETF. It is not, however, limited to this scope. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The package defines dialog management request elements for preparing, starting, and terminating dialog interactions, as well as associated responses and notifications.  Dialog interactions are specified in a dialog language.  This package defines a lightweight IVR dialog language (supporting prompt playback, runtime controls, Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) collection, and media recording) and allows other dialog languages to be used.  The package also defines elements for auditing package capabilities and IVR dialogs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Media Resource Brokering
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6917.html", target="_top", tooltip="The MediaCtrl working group in the IETF has proposed an architecture for controlling media services.  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is used as the signaling protocol that provides many inherent capabilities for message routing.  In addition to such signaling properties, a need exists for intelligent, application-level media service selection based on non-static signaling properties.  This is especially true when considered in conjunction with deployment architectures that include 1:M and M:N combinations of Application Servers and Media Servers.  This document introduces a Media Resource Broker (MRB) entity, which manages the availability of Media Servers and the media resource demands of Application Servers.  The document includes potential deployment options for an MRB and appropriate interfaces to Application Servers and Media Servers."];
