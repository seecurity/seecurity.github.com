Guidelines for Implementing Digital
Video Broadcasting - IPTV (DVB-IPTV)
Application-Layer Hybrid Forward Error
Correction (FEC) Protection
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Annex E of the Digital Video Broadcasting - IPTV (DVB-IPTV) technical specification defines an optional Application-Layer Forward Error Correction (AL-FEC) protocol to protect the streaming media transported using RTP.  The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol uses two layers for FEC protection.  The first (base) layer is based on the 1-D interleaved parity code.  The second (enhancement) layer is based on the Raptor code.  By offering a layered approach, the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol offers good protection against both bursty and random packet losses at a cost of decent complexity.  This document describes how one can implement the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol by using the 1-D interleaved parity code and Raptor code that have already been specified in separate documents.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time
Applications
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3550.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

RTP Payload Format for 1-D Interleaved
Parity Forward Error Correction (FEC)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6015.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a new RTP payload format for the Forward Error Correction (FEC) that is generated by the 1-D interleaved parity code from a source media encapsulated in RTP.  The 1-D interleaved parity code is a systematic code, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent in a repair flow separate from the source flow that carries the source symbols.  The 1-D interleaved parity code offers a good protection against bursty packet losses at a cost of reasonable complexity.  The new payload format defined in this document should only be used (with some exceptions) as a part of the Digital Video Broadcasting-IPTV (DVB- IPTV) Application-layer FEC specification.

Raptor Forward Error Correction (FEC)
Schemes for FECFRAME
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6681.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction (FEC) Schemes for the Raptor and RaptorQ codes and their application to reliable delivery of media streams in the context of the FEC Framework.  The Raptor and RaptorQ codes are systematic codes, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent in one or more repair flows in addition to the source symbols that are sent to the receiver(s) within a source flow.  The Raptor and RaptorQ codes offer close to optimal protection against arbitrary packet losses at a low computational complexity.  Six FEC Schemes are defined: two for the protection of arbitrary packet flows, two that are optimized for small source blocks, and two for the protection of a single flow that already contains a sequence number.  Repair data may be sent over arbitrary datagram transport (e.g., UDP) or using RTP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
