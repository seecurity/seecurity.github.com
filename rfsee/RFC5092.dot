As the scope of Internet mail expands to support more diverse media (such as voice mail) and devices (such as cell phones) and to provide rich interactions with other services (such as web portals and legal compliance systems), the need for an interoperable notification system increases. This document attempts to enumerate the types of events that interest real-world consumers of such a system.
