Explicit Host-to-Network Flow
Measurements Techniques
2023", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes protocol-independent methods called Explicit Host-to-Network Flow Measurement Techniques that can be applicable to transport-layer protocols between the client and server.  These methods employ just a few marking bits inside the header of each packet for performance measurements and require the client and server to collaborate.  Both endpoints cooperate by marking packets and, possibly, mirroring the markings on the round-trip connection.  The techniques are especially valuable when applied to protocols that encrypt transport headers since they enable loss and delay measurements by passive, on-path network devices.  This document describes several methods that can be used separately or jointly depending of the availability of marking bits, desired measurements, and properties of the protocol to which the methods are applied.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Transport Protocol Path Signals
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8558.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the nature of signals seen by on-path elements examining transport protocols, contrasting implicit and explicit signals.  For example, TCP's state machine uses a series of well-known messages that are exchanged in the clear.  Because these are visible to network elements on the path between the two nodes setting up the transport connection, they are often used as signals by those network elements.  In transports that do not exchange these messages in the clear, on-path network elements lack those signals.  Often, the removal of those signals is intended by those moving the messages to confidential channels.  Where the endpoints desire that network elements along the path receive these signals, this document recommends explicit signals be used."];
