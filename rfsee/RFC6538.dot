Host Identity Protocol

HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes.  HIP is based on a Sigma-compliant Diffie- Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.  The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the- middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional encryption for upper- layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.

An IPv6 Prefix for Overlay Routable
Cryptographic Hash Identifiers (ORCHID)
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4843.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document introduces Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers (ORCHID) as a new, experimental class of IPv6-address- like identifiers. These identifiers are intended to be used as endpoint identifiers at applications and Application Programming Interfaces (API) and not as identifiers for network location at the IP layer, i.e., locators. They are designed to appear as application layer entities and at the existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not appear in actual IPv6 headers. To make them more like vanilla IPv6 addresses, they are expected to be routable at an overlay level. Consequently, while they are considered non-routable addresses from the IPv6 layer point-of-view, all existing IPv6 applications are expected to be able to use them in a manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses. This document requests IANA to allocate a temporary prefix out of the IPv6 addressing space for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers. By default, the prefix will be returned to IANA in 2014, with continued use requiring IETF consensus. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

NAT and Firewall Traversal Issues of
Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
Communication
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5207.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) changes the way in which two Internet hosts communicate.  One key advantage over other schemes is that HIP does not require modifications to the traditional network- layer functionality of the Internet, i.e., its routers.  In the current Internet, however, many devices other than routers modify the traditional network-layer behavior of the Internet.  These middleboxes are intermediary devices that perform functions other than the standard functions of an IP router on the datagram path between source and destination hosts.  Whereas some types of middleboxes may not interfere with HIP at all, others can affect some aspects of HIP communication, and others can render HIP communication impossible.  This document discusses the problems associated with HIP communication across network paths that include specific types of middleboxes, namely, network address translators and firewalls.  It identifies and discusses issues in the current HIP specifications that affect communication across these types of middleboxes.  This document is a product of the IRTF HIP Research Group.

Mobility Support in IPv6
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6275.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies Mobile IPv6, a protocol that allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.
