Experiments in network clock
synchronization
1985", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This RFC discusses some experiments in clock synchronization in the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  One of the services frequently neglected in computer network design is a high-quality, time-of-day clock capable of generating accurate timestamps with small errors compared to one-way network delays.  Such a service would be useful for tracing the progress of complex transactions, synchronizing cached data bases, monitoring network performance and isolating problems.  In this memo one such clock service design will be described and its performance assessed.  This design has been incorporated as an integral part of the network routing and control protocols of the Distributed Computer Network (DCnet) architecture.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
