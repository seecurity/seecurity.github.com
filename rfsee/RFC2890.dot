Load-Balancing for Mesh Softwires

Currently, the payload of a packet entering the Softwire can only be interpreted by the ingress and egress routers.  Thus, the load-balancing decision of a core router is only based on the encapsulating header, presenting much less entropy than available in the payload or the encapsulated header since the Softwire encapsulation acts in a tunneling fashion.  This document describes a method for achieving comparable load-balancing efficiency in a network carrying Softwire mesh service over Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) over IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) encapsulation to what would be achieved without such encapsulation.

Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation for Data

2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8350.html", target="_top", tooltip="Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) is a protocol for encapsulating a station's data frames between the Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller (AC).  Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data frames can be either locally bridged or tunneled to the AC.  When tunneled, a CAPWAP Data Channel is used for tunneling.  In many deployments, encapsulating data frames to an entity other than the AC (for example, to an Access Router (AR)) is desirable.  Furthermore, it may also be desirable to use different tunnel encapsulation modes between the WTP and the Access Router.  This document defines an extension to the CAPWAP protocol that supports this capability and refers to it as alternate tunnel encapsulation.  The alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint different from the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many known encapsulation types, such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, or CAPWAP.  The WTP may advertise support for alternate tunnel encapsulation during the discovery and join process, and the AC may select one of the supported alternate tunnel encapsulation types while configuring the WTP."];
