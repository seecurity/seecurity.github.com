Terminology for Benchmarking Link-State
IGP Data-Plane Route Convergence

The terminology is to be used for benchmarking IGP convergence time through externally observable (black-box) data-plane measurements.  The terminology can be applied to any link-state IGP, such as IS-IS and OSPF.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

It is of utmost importance to ensure that when a BGP peer or a downstream link of a BGP peer fails, the alternate paths are rapidly used and routes via these alternate paths are installed.  This document provides the basic BGP benchmarking methodology using existing BGP convergence terminology as defined in RFC 4098."];
