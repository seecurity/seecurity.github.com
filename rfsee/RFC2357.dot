Multicast Negative-Acknowledgment (NACK)
Building Blocks
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5401.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the creation of reliable multicast protocols that utilize negative-acknowledgment (NACK) feedback.  The rationale for protocol design goals and assumptions are presented.  Technical challenges for NACK-based (and in some cases general) reliable multicast protocol operation are identified.  These goals and challenges are resolved into a set of functional building blocks that address different aspects of reliable multicast protocol operation.  It is anticipated that these building blocks will be useful in generating different instantiations of reliable multicast protocols.  This document obsoletes RFC 3941. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM)
Transport Protocol
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5740.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the messages and procedures of the Negative- ACKnowledgment (NACK) Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol.  This protocol can provide end-to-end reliable transport of bulk data objects or streams over generic IP multicast routing and forwarding services.  NORM uses a selective, negative acknowledgment mechanism for transport reliability and offers additional protocol mechanisms to allow for operation with minimal a priori coordination among senders and receivers.  A congestion control scheme is specified to allow the NORM protocol to fairly share available network bandwidth with other transport protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  It is capable of operating with both reciprocal multicast routing among senders and receivers and with asymmetric connectivity (possibly a unicast return path) between the senders and receivers.  The protocol offers a number of features to allow different types of applications or possibly other higher-level transport protocols to utilize its service in different ways.  The protocol leverages the use of FEC-based (forward error correction) repair and other IETF Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks in its design.  This document obsoletes RFC 3940.
