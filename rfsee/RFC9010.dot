Listener Subscription for IPv6 Neighbor

Addresses
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9685.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document updates the 6LoWPAN extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (specified in RFCs 4861 and 8505) to enable a listener to subscribe to an IPv6 anycast or multicast address.  This document also updates the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) (specified in RFCs 6550 and 6553) to add a new Non-Storing multicast mode and new support for anycast addresses in Storing and Non-Storing modes.  This document extends RFC 9010 to enable a 6LoWPAN Router (6LR) to inject the anycast and multicast addresses in RPL."];

AODV-RPL: The Routing Protocol for Low-

Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV)
Routing
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9854.html", target="_top", tooltip="Route discovery for symmetric and asymmetric Peer-to-Peer (P2P) traffic flows is a desirable feature in Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs).  For that purpose, this document specifies AODV-RPL -- the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) based on Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing.  AODV-RPL is a reactive P2P route discovery mechanism for both hop-by-hop routes and source routing.  Paired instances are used to construct directional paths for cases where there are asymmetric links between source and target nodes."];
