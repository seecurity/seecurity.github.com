Group Communication for the Constrained
Application Protocol (CoAP)
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7390.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for constrained devices and constrained networks.  It is anticipated that constrained devices will often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building automation scenario, all lights in a given room may need to be switched on/off as a group).  This specification defines how CoAP should be used in a group communication context.  An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed based on existing CoAP functionality as well as new features introduced in this specification.  Also, various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate important concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for deployment in various network topologies."];

First-Hop Router Selection by Hosts in a
Multi-Prefix Network
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8028.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a scenario that has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that is assumed to implement BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host has multiple routers to choose from.  It also applies to other scenarios such as the usage of stateful firewalls that effectively act as address-based filters.  Host behavior in choosing a first-hop router may interact with source address selection in a given implementation.  However, the selection of the source address for a packet is done before the first-hop router for that packet is chosen.  Given that the network or host is, or appears to be, multihomed with multiple provider-allocated addresses, that the host has elected to use a source address in a given prefix, and that some but not all neighboring routers are advertising that prefix in their Router Advertisement Prefix Information Options, this document specifies to which router a host should present its transmission.  It updates RFC 4861."];

UDP Usage Guidelines
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8085.html", target="_top", tooltip="The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms. This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP. Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), and ports. Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic. They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP. Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion control. This document obsoletes RFC 5405 and adds guidelines for multicast UDP usage."];
