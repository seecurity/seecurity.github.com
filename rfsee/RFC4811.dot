OSPF Out-of-Band Link State Database
(LSDB) Resynchronization
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks. Link State Database (LSDB) synchronization in OSPF is achieved via two methods -- initial LSDB synchronization when an OSPF router has just been connected to the network and asynchronous flooding that ensures continuous LSDB synchronization in the presence of topology changes after the initial procedure was completed. It may sometime be necessary for OSPF routers to resynchronize their LSDBs. The OSPF standard, however, does not allow routers to do so without actually changing the topology view of the network. This memo describes a vendor-specific mechanism to perform such a form of out-of-band LSDB synchronization. The mechanism described in this document was proposed before Graceful OSPF Restart, as described in RFC 3623, came into existence. It is implemented/supported by at least one major vendor and is currently deployed in the field. The purpose of this document is to capture the details of this mechanism for public use. This mechanism is not an IETF standard. This memo provides information for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Graceful OSPF Restart

This is called graceful restart or non-stop forwarding.  A restarting router may not be capable of adjusting its forwarding in a timely manner when the network topology changes.  In order to avoid the possible resulting routing loops, the procedure in this memo automatically reverts to a normal OSPF restart when such a topology change is detected, or when one or more of the restarting router's neighbors do not support the enhancements in this memo.  Proper network operation during a graceful restart makes assumptions upon the operating environment of the restarting router; these assumptions are also documented."];

OSPF Restart Signaling

Routers find new and detect unreachable neighbors via the Hello subprotocol. Hello OSPF packets are also used to ensure two-way connectivity within time. When a router restarts its OSPF software, it may not know its neighbors. If such a router sends a Hello packet on an interface, its neighbors are going to reset the adjacency, which may not be desirable in certain conditions. This memo describes a vendor-specific mechanism that allows OSPF routers to inform their neighbors about the restart process. Note that this mechanism requires support from neighboring routers.
