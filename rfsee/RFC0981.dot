The primary route (a minimum-distance path), and additional paths ordered by distance, which serve as alternate routes should the primary route fail, are computed.  This prototype is presented as an example of a class of routing algorithms and data-base management techniques that may find wider application in the Internet community.  Discussions and suggestions for improvements are welcomed.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
