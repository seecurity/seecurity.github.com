Experimental multiple-path routing
algorithm
1986", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document introduces wiretap algorithms, a class of experimental, multiple routing algorithms that compute quasi-optimum routes for stations sharing a packet-radio broadcast channel.  The primary route (a minimum-distance path), and additional paths ordered by distance, which serve as alternate routes should the primary route fail, are computed.  This prototype is presented as an example of a class of routing algorithms and data-base management techniques that may find wider application in the Internet community.  Discussions and suggestions for improvements are welcomed."];
