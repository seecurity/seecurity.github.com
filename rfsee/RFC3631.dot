Security Mechanisms for the Internet

Many security problems can be traced to improper implementations.  However, even a proper implementation will have security problems if the fundamental protocol is itself exploitable.  Exactly how security should be implemented in a protocol will vary, because of the structure of the protocol itself.  However, there are many protocols for which standard Internet security mechanisms, already developed, may be applicable.  The precise one that is appropriate in any given situation can vary.
