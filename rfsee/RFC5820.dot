Extensions to OSPF to Support Mobile Ad
Hoc Networking
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes extensions to OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).  The extensions, called OSPF-OR (OSPF-Overlapping Relay), include mechanisms for link-local signaling (LLS), an OSPF-MANET interface, a simple technique to reduce the size of Hello packets by only transmitting incremental state changes, and a method for optimized flooding of routing updates.  OSPF-OR also provides a means to reduce unnecessary adjacencies to support larger MANETs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
