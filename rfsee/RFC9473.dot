Current Open Questions in Path-Aware
Networking
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9217.html", target="_top", tooltip="In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware internetworking architecture has two important properties: it exposes the properties of available Internet paths to endpoints, and it provides for endpoints and applications to use these properties to select paths through the Internet for their traffic. While this property of path awareness already exists in many Internet-connected networks within single domains and via administrative interfaces to the network layer, a fully path-aware internetwork expands these concepts across layers and across the Internet. This document poses questions in path-aware networking, open as of 2021, that must be answered in the design, development, and deployment of path-aware internetworks. It was originally written to frame discussions in the Path Aware Networking Research Group (PANRG), and has been published to snapshot current thinking in this space."];

An Extension for Application-Layer
Traffic Optimization (ALTO): Path Vector
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9275.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol.  It extends the ALTO cost map and ALTO property map services so that an application can decide to which endpoint(s) to connect based not only on numerical/ordinal cost values but also on fine-grained abstract information regarding the paths.  This is useful for applications whose performance is impacted by specific components of a network on the end-to-end paths, e.g., they may infer that several paths share common links and prevent traffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths.  This extension introduces a new abstraction called the Abstract Network Element (ANE) to represent these components and encodes a network path as a vector of ANEs.  Thus, it provides a more complete but still abstract graph representation of the underlying network(s) for informed traffic optimization among endpoints."];

Such applications often transfer large amounts of data through connections established between nodes distributed across the Internet with little knowledge of the underlying network topology. Some applications are so designed that they choose a random subset of peers from a larger set with which to exchange data. Absent any topology information guiding such choices, or acting on suboptimal or local information obtained from measurements and statistics, these applications often make less than desirable choices.

This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network class within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. This document obsoletes RFC 1771. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

TCP Extensions for Multipath Operation

The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and thus improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure. Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., a reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.

For example, TCP's state machine uses a series of well-known messages that are exchanged in the clear.  Because these are visible to network elements on the path between the two nodes setting up the transport connection, they are often used as signals by those network elements.  In transports that do not exchange these messages in the clear, on-path network elements lack those signals.  Often, the removal of those signals is intended by those moving the messages to confidential channels.  Where the endpoints desire that network elements along the path receive these signals, this document recommends explicit signals be used."];

Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
(ALTO) Performance Cost Metrics
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9439.html", target="_top", tooltip="The cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
Optimization (ALTO), and different applications may use different
types of cost metrics. Since the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285)
defines only a single cost metric (namely, the generic routingcost
metric), if an application wants to issue a cost map or an endpoint
cost request in order to identify a resource provider that offers
better performance metrics (e.g., lower delay or loss rate), the base
protocol does not define the cost metric to be used. This document addresses this issue by extending the specification to
provide a variety of network performance metrics, including network
delay, delay variation (a.k.a. jitter), packet loss rate, hop count,
and bandwidth. There are multiple sources (e.g., estimations based on measurements
or a Service Level Agreement) available for deriving a performance
metric. This document introduces an additional cost-context field
