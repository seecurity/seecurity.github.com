DECoupled Application Data Enroute
(DECADE)
2013", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Content distribution applications, such as those employing peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies, are widely used on the Internet and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.  Often, however, content distribution applications use network resources inefficiently.  One way to improve efficiency is to introduce storage capabilities within the network and enable cooperation between end-host and in-network content distribution mechanisms.  This is the capability provided by a DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) system, which is introduced in this document.  DECADE enables applications to take advantage of in-network storage when distributing data objects as opposed to using solely end-to-end resources.  This document presents the underlying principles and key functionalities of such a system and illustrates operation through a set of examples."];

DECoupled Application Data Enroute
(DECADE) Problem Statement
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6646.html", target="_top", tooltip="Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on the Internet today and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.  In P2P applications, one technique for reducing the transit and uplink P2P traffic is to introduce storage capabilities within the network.  Traditional caches (e.g., P2P and Web caches) provide such storage, but they can be complex (e.g., P2P caches need to explicitly support individual P2P application protocols), and do not allow users to manage resource usage policies for content in the cache.  This document discusses the introduction of in-network storage for P2P applications and shows the need for a standard protocol for accessing this storage.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Network File System (NFS) Version 4
Minor Version 1 Protocol
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5661.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 3530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.  Major extensions introduced in NFS version 4 minor version 1 include Sessions, Directory Delegations, and parallel NFS (pNFS).  NFS version 4 minor version 1 has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and it is considered a separate protocol.  Thus, this document neither updates nor obsoletes RFC 3530.  NFS minor version 1 is deemed superior to NFS minor version 0 with no loss of functionality, and its use is preferred over version 0.  Both NFS minor versions 0 and 1 can be used simultaneously on the same network, between the same client and server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Naming Things with Hashes

It specifies a new URI scheme for this purpose, a way to map these to HTTP URLs, and binary and human-speakable formats for these names.  The various formats are designed to support, but not require, a strong link to the referenced object, such that the referenced object may be authenticated to the same degree as the reference to it.  The reason for this work is to standardise current uses of hash outputs in URLs and to support new information-centric applications and other uses of hash outputs in protocols."];
