Telnet terminal location number option
1985", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Many systems provide a mechanism for finding out where a user is logged in from usually including information about telephone extension and office occupants names.  The information is useful for physically locating people and/or calling them on the phone.  In 1982 CMU designed and implemented a terminal location database and modified existing network software to handle a 64-bit number called the Terminal Location Number (or TTYLOC).  It now seems appropriate to incorporate this mechanism into the TCP-based network protocol family.  The mechanism is not viewed as a replacement for the Terminal Location Telnet Option (SEND-LOCATION) but as a shorthand mechansim for communicating terminal location information between hosts in a localized community.  This RFC proposes a new option for Telnet for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
