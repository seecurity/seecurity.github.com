Multiple Key Exchanges in the Internet
Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9370.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes how to extend the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) to allow multiple key exchanges to take place while computing a shared secret during a Security Association (SA) setup. This document utilizes the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchange, where multiple key exchanges are performed when an IKE SA is being established. It also introduces a new IKEv2 exchange, IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE, which is used for the same purpose when the IKE SA is being rekeyed or is creating additional Child SAs. This document updates RFC 7296 by renaming a Transform Type 4 from Diffie-Hellman Group (D-H) to Key Exchange Method (KE) and renaming a field in the Key Exchange Payload from Diffie-Hellman Group Num to Key Exchange Method. It also renames an IANA registry for this Transform Type from Transform Type 4 - Diffie- Hellman Group Transform IDs to Transform Type 4 - Key Exchange Method Transform IDs. These changes generalize key exchange algorithms that can be used in IKEv2."];

Related Certificates for Use in Multiple
Authentications within a Protocol
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9763.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a new Certificate Signing Request (CSR) attribute, relatedCertRequest, and a new X.509 certificate extension, RelatedCertificate.  The use of the relatedCertRequest attribute in a CSR and the inclusion of the RelatedCertificate extension in the resulting certificate together provide additional assurance that two certificates each belong to the same end entity.  This mechanism is particularly useful in the context of non-composite hybrid authentication, which enables users to employ the same certificates in hybrid authentication as in authentication done with only traditional or post-quantum algorithms."];

Hybrid Public Key Encryption
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9180.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a scheme for hybrid public key encryption (HPKE). This scheme provides a variant of public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key. It also includes three authenticated variants, including one that authenticates possession of a pre-shared key and two optional ones that authenticate possession of a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) private key. HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric KEM, key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) encryption function. Some authenticated variants may not be supported by all KEMs. We provide instantiations of the scheme using widely used and efficient primitives, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF), and SHA2. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF."];
