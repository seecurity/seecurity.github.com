FTP Transport for Secure Peer-to-Peer
Business Data Interchange over the
Internet
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This Applicability Statement (AS) describes how to exchange structured business data securely using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for XML, Binary, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI - ANSI X12 or UN/EDIFACT), or other data used for business-to-business data interchange for which MIME packaging can be accomplished using standard MIME content types.  Authentication and data confidentiality are obtained by using Cryptographic Message Syntax (S/MIME) security body parts.  Authenticated acknowledgements employ multipart/signed replies to the original message.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8996.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document formally deprecates Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346). Accordingly, those documents have been moved to Historic status. These versions lack support for current and recommended cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms, and various government and industry profiles of applications using TLS now mandate avoiding these old TLS versions. TLS version 1.2 became the recommended version for IETF protocols in 2008 (subsequently being obsoleted by TLS version 1.3 in 2018), providing sufficient time to transition away from older versions. Removing support for older versions from implementations reduces the attack surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines library and product maintenance. This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC 4347) but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1. This document updates many RFCs that normatively refer to TLS version 1.0 or TLS version 1.1, as described herein. This document also updates the best practices for TLS usage in RFC 7525; hence, it is part of BCP 195."];

Multiple Attachments for Electronic Data
Interchange - Internet Integration
(EDIINT)
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6362.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Electronic Data Interchange - Internet Integration (EDIINT) AS1, AS2, and AS3 messages were designed specifically for the transport of EDI documents.  Since multiple interchanges could be placed within a single EDI document, there was not a need for sending multiple EDI documents in a single message.  As adoption of EDIINT grew, other uses developed aside from single EDI document transport.  Some transactions required multiple attachments to be interpreted together and stored in a single message.  This Informational RFC describes how multiple documents, including non-EDI payloads, can be attached and transmitted in a single EDIINT transport message.  The attachments are stored within the MIME multipart/related structure.  A minimal list of content-types to be supported as attachments is provided.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
