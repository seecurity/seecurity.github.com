Sender RTT Estimate Option for the

It updates specifications for the CCID-3 and CCID-4 Congestion Control IDs of DCCP. The update addresses parameter-estimation problems occurring with TFRC-based DCCP congestion control. It uses a recommendation made in the original TFRC specification to avoid the inherent problems of receiver-based RTT sampling, by utilising higher-accuracy RTT samples already available at the sender. It is integrated into the feature set of DCCP as an end-to-end negotiable extension. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
