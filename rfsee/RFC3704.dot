Ingress Filtering for Multihomed

There are cases when this may create problems, e.g., with multihoming.

Enhanced Feasible-Path Unicast Reverse
Path Forwarding

Strict uRPF is inflexible about directionality, the loose uRPF is oblivious to directionality, and the current feasible-path uRPF attempts to strike a balance between the two (see RFC 3704).  However, as shown in this document, the existing feasible-path uRPF still has shortcomings.  This document describes enhanced feasible-path uRPF (EFP-uRPF) techniques that are more flexible (in a meaningful way) about directionality than the feasible-path uRPF (RFC 3704).  The proposed EFP-uRPF methods aim to significantly reduce false positives regarding invalid detection in source address validation (SAV).  Hence, they can potentially alleviate ISPs' concerns about the possibility of disrupting service for their customers and encourage greater deployment of uRPF techniques.

Label Switched Path (LSP) Self-Ping
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7746.html", target="_top", tooltip="When certain RSVP-TE optimizations are implemented, ingress Label Switching Router (LSRs) can receive RSVP RESV messages before forwarding state has been installed on all downstream nodes. According to the RSVP-TE specification, the ingress LSR can forward traffic through a Label Switched Path (LSP) as soon as it receives a RESV message. However, if the ingress LSR forwards traffic through the LSP before forwarding state has been installed on all downstream nodes, traffic can be lost. This document describes LSP Self-ping. When an ingress LSR receives an RESV message, it can invoke LSP Self-ping procedures to ensure that forwarding state has been installed on all downstream nodes. LSP Self-ping is a new protocol. It is not an extension of LSP Ping. Although LSP Ping and LSP Self-ping are named similarly, each is designed for a unique purpose. Each protocol listens on its own UDP port and executes its own procedures. LSP Self-ping is an extremely lightweight mechanism. It does not consume control-plane resources on transit or egress LSRs."];

Technical Considerations for Internet
Service Blocking and Filtering
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7754.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by certain parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of abusive or objectionable communications.  Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on blocking and filtering, the active prevention of such communications.  This document examines several technical approaches to Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet architecture.  When it is possible to do so, the approach to blocking and filtering that is most coherent with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or objectionable communications.  We observe that certain filtering and blocking approaches can cause unintended consequences to third parties, and we discuss the limits of efficacy of various approaches."];

First-Hop Router Selection by Hosts in a
Multi-Prefix Network
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8028.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a scenario that has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that is assumed to implement BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host has multiple routers to choose from.  It also applies to other scenarios such as the usage of stateful firewalls that effectively act as address-based filters.  Host behavior in choosing a first-hop router may interact with source address selection in a given implementation.  However, the selection of the source address for a packet is done before the first-hop router for that packet is chosen.  Given that the network or host is, or appears to be, multihomed with multiple provider-allocated addresses, that the host has elected to use a source address in a given prefix, and that some but not all neighboring routers are advertising that prefix in their Router Advertisement Prefix Information Options, this document specifies to which router a host should present its transmission.

Using Conditional Router Advertisements
for Enterprise Multihoming

The problem of enterprise multihoming without address translation of any form has not been solved yet as it requires both the network to select the correct egress ISP based on the packet source address and hosts to select the correct source address based on the desired egress ISP for that traffic.  The aforementioned document proposes a solution to this problem by introducing a new routing functionality (Source Address Dependent Routing) to solve the uplink selection issue.  It also proposes using Router Advertisements to influence the host source address selection.  It focuses on solving the general problem and covering various complex use cases, and this document adopts its proposed approach to provide a solution for a limited number of common use cases.  In particular, the focus of this document is on scenarios in which an enterprise network has two Internet uplinks used either in primary/backup mode or simultaneously and hosts in that network might not yet properly support multihoming as described in RFC 8028."];

Enterprise Multihoming using Provider-

Prefix Translation: Requirements and
Solutions
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8678.html", target="_top", tooltip="Connecting an enterprise site to multiple ISPs over IPv6 using provider-assigned addresses is difficult without the use of some form of Network Address Translation (NAT). Much has been written on this topic over the last 10 to 15 years, but it still remains a problem without a clearly defined or widely implemented solution. Any multihoming solution without NAT requires hosts at the site to have addresses from each ISP and to select the egress ISP by selecting a source address for outgoing packets. It also requires routers at the site to take into account those source addresses when forwarding packets out towards the ISPs. This document examines currently available mechanisms for providing a solution to this problem for a broad range of enterprise topologies. It covers the behavior of routers to forward traffic by taking into account source address, and it covers the behavior of hosts to select appropriate default source addresses. It also covers any possible role that routers might play in providing information to hosts to help them select appropriate source addresses. In the process of exploring potential solutions, this document also makes explicit requirements for how the solution would be expected to behave from the perspective of an enterprise site network administrator."];

Enhanced Feasible-Path Unicast Reverse
Path Forwarding

Strict uRPF is inflexible about directionality, the loose uRPF is oblivious to directionality, and the current feasible-path uRPF attempts to strike a balance between the two (see RFC 3704).  However, as shown in this document, the existing feasible-path uRPF still has shortcomings.  This document describes enhanced feasible-path uRPF (EFP-uRPF) techniques that are more flexible (in a meaningful way) about directionality than the feasible-path uRPF (RFC 3704).  The proposed EFP-uRPF methods aim to significantly reduce false positives regarding invalid detection in source address validation (SAV).  Hence, they can potentially alleviate ISPs' concerns about the possibility of disrupting service for their customers and encourage greater deployment of uRPF techniques.
