Downgrading Mechanism for Email Address
Internationalization
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5504.html", target="_top", tooltip="Traditional mail systems handle only ASCII characters in SMTP envelope and mail header fields.  The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension allows UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail header fields.  To avoid rejecting internationalized email messages when a server in the delivery path does not support the UTF8SMTP extension, some sort of converting mechanism is required.  This document describes a downgrading mechanism for Email Address Internationalization.  Note that this is a way to downgrade, not tunnel.  There is no associated up-conversion mechanism, although internationalized email clients might use original internationalized addresses or other data when displaying or replying to downgraded messages.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Evolution of the IP Model

The discussion of these properties is organized around evaluating a set of claims, or misconceptions.  Finally, this document provides some guidance to protocol designers and implementers.

Reflections on Host Firewalls
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7288.html", target="_top", tooltip="In today's Internet, the need for firewalls is generally accepted in the industry, and indeed firewalls are widely deployed in practice.  Unlike traditional firewalls that protect network links, host firewalls run in end-user systems.  Often the result is that software may be running and potentially consuming resources, but then communication is blocked by a host firewall.  It's taken for granted that this end state is either desirable or the best that can be achieved in practice, rather than (for example) an end state where the relevant software is not running or is running in a way that would not result in unwanted communication.  In this document, we explore the issues behind these assumptions and provide suggestions on improving the architecture going forward."];

Technical Considerations for Internet
Service Blocking and Filtering
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7754.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by certain parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of abusive or objectionable communications.  Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on blocking and filtering, the active prevention of such communications.  This document examines several technical approaches to Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet architecture.  When it is possible to do so, the approach to blocking and filtering that is most coherent with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or objectionable communications.  We observe that certain filtering and blocking approaches can cause unintended consequences to third parties, and we discuss the limits of efficacy of various approaches."];

TCP Extensions for Multipath Operation
with Multiple Addresses
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8684.html", target="_top", tooltip="TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers. The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and thus improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure. Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., a reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths. This document specifies v1 of Multipath TCP, obsoleting v0 as specified in RFC 6824, through clarifications and modifications primarily driven by deployment experience."];
