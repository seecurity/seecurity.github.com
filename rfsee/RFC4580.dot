Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
IPv6 (DHCPv6) Relay Agent Subscriber-ID
Option

Using Device-Provided Location-Related
Measurements in Location Configuration
Protocols

Location-related measurement information provides observations concerning properties related to the position of a Device; this information could be data about network attachment or about the physical environment.  A LIS is able to use the location-related measurement data to improve the accuracy of the location estimate it provides to the Device.  A basic set of location-related measurements are defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters."];
