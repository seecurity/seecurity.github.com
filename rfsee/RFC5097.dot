MIB for the UDP-Lite protocol
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies a Management Information Base (MIB) module for the Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite).  It defines a set of new MIB objects to characterise the behaviour and performance of transport layer endpoints deploying UDP-Lite.  UDP-Lite resembles UDP, but differs from the semantics of UDP by the addition of a single option.  This adds the capability for variable-length data checksum coverage, which can benefit a class of applications that prefer delivery of (partially) corrupted datagram payload data in preference to discarding the datagram.

The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the Framework over time.  The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.  The document also recommends that RFCs 1157, 1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic status.  This document obsoletes RFC 2570.
