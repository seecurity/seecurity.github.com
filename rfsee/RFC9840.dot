Low Extra Delay Background Transport
(LEDBAT)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6817.html", target="_top", tooltip="Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) is an experimental delay-based congestion control algorithm that seeks to utilize the available bandwidth on an end-to-end path while limiting the consequent increase in queueing delay on that path.  LEDBAT uses changes in one-way delay measurements to limit congestion that the flow itself induces in the network.  LEDBAT is designed for use by background bulk-transfer applications to be no more aggressive than standard TCP congestion control (as specified in RFC 5681) and to yield in the presence of competing flows, thus limiting interference with the network performance of competing flows.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

CUBIC for Fast and Long-Distance
Networks
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9438.html", target="_top", tooltip="CUBIC is a standard TCP congestion control algorithm that uses a cubic function instead of a linear congestion window increase function to improve scalability and stability over fast and long-distance networks. CUBIC has been adopted as the default TCP congestion control algorithm by the Linux, Windows, and Apple stacks. This document updates the specification of CUBIC to include algorithmic improvements based on these implementations and recent academic work. Based on the extensive deployment experience with CUBIC, this document also moves the specification to the Standards Track and obsoletes RFC 8312. This document also updates RFC 5681, to allow for CUBIC's occasionally more aggressive sending behavior."];

TCP is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet.  Over this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion.  This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793.  This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793.  It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements.  It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state.  The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168."];

This document describes a specific algorithm for responding to partial acknowledgments, referred to as NewReno.  This response to partial acknowledgments was first proposed by Janey Hoe.
