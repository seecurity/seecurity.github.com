Handling Long Lines in Content of

2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8792.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in width-bounded text content.  One strategy, called the single backslash strategy, is based on the historical use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where line-folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character that is not a space character (' ') on the next line.  The second strategy, called the double backslash strategy, extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the continuation begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported by the first strategy.  Both strategies use a self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the original content."];

To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed.
