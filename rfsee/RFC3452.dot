Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building

2002", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document generally describes how to use Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for data transport.  The primary focus of this document is the application of FEC codes to one-to-many reliable data transport using IP multicast.  This document describes what information is needed to identify a specific FEC code, what information needs to be communicated out-of-band to use the FEC code, and what information is needed in data packets to identify the encoding symbols they carry.  The procedures for specifying FEC codes and registering them with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) are also described.  This document should be read in conjunction with and uses the terminology of the companion document titled, The Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) in Reliable Multicast.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5052.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes how to use Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for bulk data transfer over IP multicast.  This document defines a framework for the definition of the information that needs to be communicated in order to use an FEC code for bulk data transfer, in addition to the encoded data itself, and for definition of formats and codes for communication of that information.  Both information communicated with the encoded data itself and information that needs to be communicated 'out-of-band' are considered.  The procedures for specifying new FEC codes, defining the information communication requirements associated with those codes and registering them with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) are also described.  The requirements on Content Delivery Protocols that wish to use FEC codes defined within this framework are also defined.  The companion document titled The Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) in Reliable Multicast describes some applications of FEC codes for delivering content.  This document obsoletes RFC 3452.
