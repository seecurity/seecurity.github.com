Opportunistic Encryption using the
Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes opportunistic encryption (OE) as designed and implemented by the Linux FreeS/WAN project. OE uses the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and IPsec protocols. The objective is to allow encryption for secure communication without any pre-arrangement specific to the pair of systems involved. DNS is used to distribute the public keys of each system involved. This is resistant to passive attacks. The use of DNS Security (DNSSEC) secures this system against active attackers as well. As a result, the administrative overhead is reduced from the square of the number of systems to a linear dependence, and it becomes possible to make secure communication the default even when the partner is not known in advance.

Limiting the Scope of the KEY Resource
Record (RR)
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3445.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document limits the Domain Name System (DNS) KEY Resource Record (RR) to only keys used by the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).  The original KEY RR used sub-typing to store both DNSSEC keys and arbitrary application keys.  Storing both DNSSEC and application keys with the same record type is a mistake.  This document removes application keys from the KEY record by redefining the Protocol Octet field in the KEY RR Data.  As a result of removing application keys, all but one of the flags in the KEY record become unnecessary and are redefined.  Three existing application key sub-types are changed to reserved, but the format of the KEY record is not changed.  This document updates RFC 2535. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

This document is a snapshot of IPsec- and IKE-related RFCs. It includes a brief description of each RFC, along with background information explaining the motivation and context of IPsec's outgrowths and extensions. It obsoletes RFC 2411, the previous IP Security Document Roadmap. The obsoleted IPsec roadmap (RFC 2411) briefly described the interrelationship of the various classes of base IPsec documents. The major focus of RFC 2411 was to specify the recommended contents of documents specifying additional encryption and authentication algorithms.

The discussions covered issues of terminology, the role of user interfaces, classes of mitigation, some specific use cases, transition strategies (including opportunistic encryption), and more.
