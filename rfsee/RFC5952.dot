Further, these properties are presented as maps, similar to the network and cost maps in the base ALTO Protocol.  While supporting the endpoints and related Endpoint Property Service defined in RFC 7285, the ALTO Protocol is extended in two major directions.  First, from endpoints restricted to IP addresses to entities covering a wider and extensible set of objects; second, from properties for specific endpoints to entire entity property maps.  These extensions introduce additional features that allow entities and property values to be specific to a given information resource.

They also enable aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible with CNAME.  The HTTPS RR is a variation of SVCB for use with HTTP (see RFC 9110, HTTP Semantics).
