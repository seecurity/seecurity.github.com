(RPKI) Signed Objects
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9589.html", target="_top", tooltip="In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), Signed Objects are defined as Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected content types.  A Signed Object contains a signing-time attribute, representing the purported time at which the object was signed by its issuer.  RPKI repositories are accessible using the rsync and RPKI Repository Delta protocols, allowing Relying Parties (RPs) to synchronize a local copy of the RPKI repository used for validation with the remote repositories.  This document describes how the CMS signing-time attribute can be used to avoid needless retransfers of data when switching between different synchronization protocols.  This document updates RFC 6488 by mandating the presence of the CMS signing-time attribute and disallowing the use of the binary-signing-time attribute."];

A Profile for Resource Public Key
Infrastructure (RPKI) Trust Anchor Keys
(TAKs)

This document defines an RPKI signed object for a Trust Anchor Key (TAK).  A TAK object can be used by a TA to signal to RPs the location(s) of the accompanying CA certificate for the current public key, as well as the successor public key and the location(s) of its CA certificate.  This object helps to support planned key rollovers without impacting RPKI validation."];
