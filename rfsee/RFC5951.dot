Network Management Requirements for
MPLS-based Transport Networks
2010", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies the requirements for the management of equipment used in networks supporting an MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  The requirements are defined for specification of network management aspects of protocol mechanisms and procedures that constitute the building blocks out of which the MPLS Transport Profile is constructed.  That is, these requirements indicate what management capabilities need to be available in MPLS for use in managing the MPLS-TP.  This document is intended to identify essential network management capabilities, not to specify what functions any particular MPLS implementation supports.

MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Control
Plane Framework
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6373.html", target="_top", tooltip="The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) supports static provisioning of transport paths via a Network Management System (NMS) and dynamic provisioning of transport paths via a control plane. This document provides the framework for MPLS-TP dynamic provisioning and covers control-plane addressing, routing, path computation, signaling, traffic engineering, and path recovery. MPLS-TP uses GMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs). MPLS-TP also uses the pseudowire (PW) control plane for pseudowires. Management-plane functions are out of scope of this document. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.

Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport
Profile (MPLS-TP) MIB-Based Management
Overview

These MIB modules are defined in separate documents that focus on the specific areas of responsibility of the modules that they describe. The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLS functionality specific to the construction of packet-switched transport networks. This document describes the MIB-based architecture for MPLS-TP, indicates the interrelationships between different existing MIB modules that can be leveraged for MPLS-TP network management, and identifies areas where additional MIB modules are required.

The International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has specified a Transport Network architecture. This document provides a thesaurus for the interpretation of MPLS-TP terminology within the context of the ITU-T Transport Network Recommendations. It is important to note that MPLS-TP is applicable in a wider set of contexts than just Transport Networks. The definitions presented in this document do not provide exclusive or complete interpretations of MPLS-TP concepts. This document simply allows the MPLS-TP terms to be applied within the Transport Network context."];
