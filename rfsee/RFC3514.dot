ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for
Unicast Secure RTP
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6189.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines ZRTP, a protocol for media path Diffie-Hellman exchange to agree on a session key and parameters for establishing unicast Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) sessions for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.  The ZRTP protocol is media path keying because it is multiplexed on the same port as RTP and does not require support in the signaling protocol.  ZRTP does not assume a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or require the complexity of certificates in end devices.  For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication.  ZRTP can utilize a Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication through the signaling channel.  To provide best effort SRTP, ZRTP utilizes normal RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) profiles.  ZRTP secures media sessions that include a voice media stream and can also secure media sessions that do not include voice by using an optional digital signature.

Congestion Exposure (ConEx) Concepts,

Today, network elements at any layer may signal congestion to the receiver by dropping packets or by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) markings, and the receiver passes this information back to the sender in transport-layer feedback.  The mechanism described here enables the sender to also relay this congestion information back into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total amount of congestion from all elements on the path is revealed to all IP elements along the path, where it could, for example, be used to provide input to traffic management.  This mechanism is called Congestion Exposure, or ConEx.  The companion document, Congestion Exposure (ConEx) Concepts and Use Cases (RFC 6789), provides the entry point to the set of ConEx documentation."];
