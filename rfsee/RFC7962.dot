Alternative Network Deployments:
Taxonomy, Characterization,
Technologies, and Architectures
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document presents a taxonomy of a set of Alternative Network Deployments that emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people or providing a local communication infrastructure to serve various complementary needs and objectives. They employ architectures and topologies different from those of mainstream networks and rely on alternative governance and business models. The document also surveys the technologies deployed in these networks, and their differing architectural characteristics, including a set of definitions and shared properties. The classification considers models such as Community Networks, Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs), networks owned by individuals but leased out to network operators who use them as a low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, networks that provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users, and rural utility cooperatives.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4271.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol. The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network class within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. This document obsoletes RFC 1771. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Optimized Link State Routing Protocol
(OLSR)
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3626.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks.  The protocol is an optimization of the classical link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of a mobile wireless LAN.  The key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs).  MPRs are selected nodes which forward broadcast messages during the flooding process.  This technique substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it receives the first copy of the message.  In OLSR, link state information is generated only by nodes elected as MPRs.  Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control messages flooded in the network.  As a third optimization, an MPR node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors.  Hence, as contrary to the classic link state algorithm, partial link state information is distributed in the network.  This information is then used for route calculation.  OLSR provides optimal routes (in terms of number of hops).  The protocol is particularly suitable for large and dense networks as the technique of MPRs works well in this context."];
