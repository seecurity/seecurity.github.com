For example, the call may have been dropped by accident without the call taker having sufficient information about the current state of an accident victim. A call taker may trigger a callback to the emergency caller using the contact information provided with the initial emergency call. This callback could, under certain circumstances, be treated like any other call and, as a consequence, it may get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an answering machine. The IETF emergency services architecture specification already offers a solution approach for allowing Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) callbacks to bypass authorization policies in order to reach the caller without unnecessary delays. Unfortunately, the specified mechanism only supports limited scenarios. This document discusses shortcomings of the current mechanisms and illustrates additional scenarios where better-than-normal call treatment behavior would be desirable. We describe a solution based on a new header field value for the SIP Priority header field, called psap-callback, to mark PSAP callbacks."];

Additional Data Related to an Emergency
Call

This document describes data structures and mechanisms to convey such data to the PSAP. The intent is that every emergency call carry as much of the information described here as possible using the mechanisms described here. The mechanisms permit the data to be conveyed by reference (as an external resource) or by value (within the body of a SIP message or a location object). This follows the tradition of prior emergency services standardization work where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling (i.e., in the body of the SIP message) or by reference."];

This document also registers MIME media types and an Emergency Call Data Type for the eCall vehicle data and metadata/control data, and an INFO package to enable carrying this data in SIP INFO requests.

Next-Generation Vehicle-Initiated
Emergency Calls
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8148.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms to support the next generation of emergency calls placed by vehicles (automatically in the event of a crash or serious incident, or manually invoked by a vehicle occupant) and conveying vehicle, sensor, and location data related to the crash or incident. Such calls are often referred to as Automatic Crash Notification (ACN), or Advanced Automatic Crash Notification (AACN), even in the case of manual trigger. The Advanced qualifier refers to the ability to carry a richer set of data. This document also registers a MIME media type and Emergency Call Data Type for the vehicle, sensor, and location data (often referred to as crash data even though there is not necessarily a crash) and an INFO package to enable carrying this and related data in SIP INFO requests. An external specification for the data format, contents, and structure is referenced in this document. This document reuses the technical aspects of next-generation Pan- European eCall (a mandated and standardized system for emergency calls by in-vehicle systems (IVSs) within Europe and other regions). However, this document specifies use of a different set of vehicle (crash) data, specifically, the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) rather than the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD). This document is an extension of the IETF eCall document, with the primary differences being that this document makes the MSD data set optional and VEDS mandatory, and it adds attribute values to the metadata/control object to permit greater functionality. This document registers a new INFO package (identical to that registered for eCall but with the addition of the VEDS MIME type). This document also describes legacy (circuit-switched) ACN systems and their migration to next-generation emergency calling, to provide background information and context."];

Non-interactive Emergency Calls

In some cases of emergency calls, the transmission of application data is all that is needed, and no interactive media channel is established: a situation referred to as 'non-interactive emergency calls', where, unlike most emergency calls, there is no two-way interactive media such as voice or video or text.  This document describes use of a SIP MESSAGE transaction that includes a container for the data based on the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).  That type of emergency request does not establish a session, distinguishing it from SIP INVITE, which does.  Any device that needs to initiate a request for emergency services without an interactive media channel would use the mechanisms in this document."];
