Updates to Asserted Identity in the
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5876.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has a mechanism for conveying the identity of the originator of a request by means of the P-Asserted-Identity and P-Preferred-Identity header fields.  These header fields are specified for use in requests using a number of SIP methods, in particular the INVITE method.  However, RFC 3325 does not specify the insertion of the P-Asserted-Identity header field by a trusted User Agent Client (UAC), does not specify the use of P-Asserted-Identity and P-Preferred-Identity header fields with certain SIP methods such as UPDATE, REGISTER, MESSAGE, and PUBLISH, and does not specify how to handle an unexpected number of URIs or unexpected URI schemes in these header fields.  This document extends RFC 3325 to cover these situations.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Extension for the Identification of
Services
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6050.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes private extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that enable a network of trusted SIP servers to assert the service of authenticated users. The use of these extensions is only applicable inside an administrative domain with previously agreed-upon policies for generation, transport, and usage of such information. This document does NOT offer a general service identification model suitable for use between different trust domains or for use in the Internet at large. The document also defines a URN to identify both services and User Agent (UA) applications. This URN can be used within the SIP header fields defined in this document to identify services, and also within the framework defined for caller preferences and callee capabilities to identify usage of both services and applications between end UAs.

Session PEERing for Multimedia
INTerconnect (SPEERMINT) Security
Threats and Suggested Countermeasures
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6404.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Session PEERing for Multimedia INTerconnect (SPEERMINT) working group (WG) provides a peering framework that leverages the building blocks of existing IETF-defined protocols such as SIP and ENUM for the interconnection between SIP Service Providers (SSPs).  The objective of this document is to identify and enumerate SPEERMINT- specific threat vectors and to give guidance for implementers on selecting appropriate countermeasures.  Security requirements for SPEERMINT that have been derived from the threats detailed in this document can be found in RFC 6271; this document provides concrete countermeasures to meet those SPEERMINT security requirements.  In this document, the different security threats related to SPEERMINT are classified into threats to the Lookup Function (LUF), the Location Routing Function (LRF), the Signaling Function (SF), and the Media Function (MF) of a specific SIP Service Provider.  Various instances of the threats are briefly introduced inside the classification.  Finally, existing security solutions for SIP and RTP/RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol) are presented to describe countermeasures currently available for such threats.  Each SSP may have connections to one or more remote SSPs through peering or transit contracts.  A potentially compromised remote SSP that attacks other SSPs is out of the scope of this document; this document focuses on attacks on an SSP from outside the trust domain such an SSP may have with other SSPs.

Secure Telephone Identity Problem
Statement and Requirements
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7340.html", target="_top", tooltip="Over the past decade, Voice over IP (VoIP) systems based on SIP have replaced many traditional telephony deployments.  Interworking VoIP systems with the traditional telephone network has reduced the overall level of calling party number and Caller ID assurances by granting attackers new and inexpensive tools to impersonate or obscure calling party numbers when orchestrating bulk commercial calling schemes, hacking voicemail boxes, or even circumventing multi-factor authentication systems trusted by banks.  Despite previous attempts to provide a secure assurance of the origin of SIP communications, we still lack effective standards for identifying the calling party in a VoIP session.  This document examines the reasons why providing identity for telephone numbers on the Internet has proven so difficult and shows how changes in the last decade may provide us with new strategies for attaching a secure identity to SIP sessions.  It also gives high-level requirements for a solution in this space."];

A P-Served-User Header Field Parameter

Session Case in the Session Initiation

A session case is metadata that captures the status of the session of a served user regardless of whether or not the served user is registered or the session originates or terminates with the served user.  This document updates RFC 5502 by defining a new P-Served-User header field parameter, orig-cdiv.  The parameter conveys the session case used by a proxy when handling an originating session after Call Diversion (CDIV) services have been invoked for the served user.  This document also fixes the ABNF in RFC 5502 and provides more guidance for using the P-Served-User header field in IP networks."];
