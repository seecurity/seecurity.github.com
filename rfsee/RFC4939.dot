Management Framework

This Framework is derived from and builds upon both the original Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv1) and the second Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv2).  The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the Framework over time.  The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.  The document also recommends that RFCs 1157, 1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic status.  This document obsoletes RFC 2570.

The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with the standardized SCSI architecture model.  SCSI is a popular family of protocols that enable systems to communicate with I/O devices, especially storage devices.  SCSI protocols are request/response application protocols with a common standardized architecture model and basic command set, as well as standardized command sets for different device classes (disks, tapes, media-changers etc.).  As system interconnects move from the classical bus structure to a network structure, SCSI has to be mapped to network transport protocols.  IP networks now meet the performance requirements of fast system interconnects and as such are good candidates to carry SCSI. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
