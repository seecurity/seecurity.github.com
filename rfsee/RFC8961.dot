Requirements for Time-Based Loss
Detection
2020", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Many protocols must detect packet loss for various reasons (e.g., to ensure reliability using retransmissions or to understand the level of congestion along a network path).  While many mechanisms have been designed to detect loss, ultimately, protocols can only count on the passage of time without delivery confirmation to declare a packet lost.  Each implementation of a time-based loss detection mechanism represents a balance between correctness and timeliness; therefore, no implementation suits all situations.  This document provides high-level requirements for time-based loss detectors appropriate for general use in unicast communication across the Internet.  Within the requirements, implementations have latitude to define particulars that best address each situation.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

It offers the following services to its users: -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data, -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size, -- sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages, -- optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association.

Transport Protocol

This protocol can provide end-to-end reliable transport of bulk data objects or streams over generic IP multicast routing and forwarding services.  NORM uses a selective, negative acknowledgment mechanism for transport reliability and offers additional protocol mechanisms to allow for operation with minimal a priori coordination among senders and receivers.  A congestion control scheme is specified to allow the NORM protocol to fairly share available network bandwidth with other transport protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  It is capable of operating with both reciprocal multicast routing among senders and receivers and with asymmetric connectivity (possibly a unicast return path) between the senders and receivers.  The protocol offers a number of features to allow different types of applications or possibly other higher-level transport protocols to utilize its service in different ways.  The protocol leverages the use of FEC-based (forward error correction) repair and other IETF Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks in its design.  This document obsoletes RFC 3940.

Forward RTO-Recovery (F-RTO): An
Algorithm for Detecting Spurious
Retransmission Timeouts with TCP
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5682.html", target="_top", tooltip="The purpose of this document is to move the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) functionality for TCP in RFC 4138 from Experimental to Standards Track status. The F-RTO support for Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) in RFC 4138 remains with Experimental status. See Appendix B for the differences between this document and RFC 4138. Spurious retransmission timeouts cause suboptimal TCP performance because they often result in unnecessary retransmission of the last window of data. This document describes the F-RTO detection algorithm for detecting spurious TCP retransmission timeouts. F-RTO is a TCP sender-only algorithm that does not require any TCP options to operate. After retransmitting the first unacknowledged segment triggered by a timeout, the F-RTO algorithm of the TCP sender monitors the incoming acknowledgments to determine whether the timeout was spurious. It then decides whether to send new segments or retransmit unacknowledged segments. The algorithm effectively helps to avoid additional unnecessary retransmissions and thereby improves TCP performance in the case of a spurious timeout. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Based on the timestamp of the first acceptable ACK that arrives during loss recovery, it decides whether loss recovery was entered unnecessarily.  The Eifel detection algorithm provides a basis for future TCP enhancements.  This includes response algorithms to back out of loss recovery by restoring a TCP sender's congestion control state.
