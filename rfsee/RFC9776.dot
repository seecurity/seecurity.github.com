Version 3 of IGMP (IGMPv3) adds support for source filtering, that is, the ability for a system to report interest in receiving packets only from specific source addresses, or from all but specific source addresses, sent to a particular multicast address. That information may be used by multicast routing protocols to avoid delivering multicast packets from specific sources to networks where there are no interested receivers. This document specifies IGMPv3. It is a revised version of RFC 3376 that includes clarifications and fixes for errata, and it is backward compatible with RFC 3376.

Multicast Source Redundancy in EVPNs

A common deployment scenario involves redundant multicast sources that ensure high availability and resiliency.  However, the presence of redundant sources can lead to duplicate IP multicast traffic in the network, causing inefficiencies and increased overhead.  This document specifies extensions to the EVPN multicast procedures that allow for the suppression of duplicate IP multicast traffic from redundant sources.  The proposed mechanisms enhance the EVPN's capability to deliver multicast traffic efficiently while maintaining high availability.  These extensions are applicable to various EVPN deployment scenarios and provide guidelines to ensure consistent and predictable behavior across diverse network topologies."];
