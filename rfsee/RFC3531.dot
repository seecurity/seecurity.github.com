A Flexible Method for Managing the
Assignment of Bits of an IPv6 Address
Block
2003", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document proposes a method to manage the assignment of bits of an IPv6 address block or range.  When an organisation needs to make an address plan for its subnets or when an ISP needs to make an address plan for its customers, this method enables the organisation to postpone the final decision on the number of bits to partition in the address space they have.  It does it by keeping the bits around the borders of the partition to be free as long as possible.  This scheme is applicable to any bits addressing scheme using bits with partitions in the space, but its first intended use is for IPv6.  It is a generalization of RFC 1219 and can be used for IPv6 assignments.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

IPv6 Unicast Address Assignment
Considerations
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5375.html", target="_top", tooltip="One fundamental aspect of any IP communications infrastructure is its addressing plan.  With its new address architecture and allocation policies, the introduction of IPv6 into a network means that network designers and operators need to reconsider their existing approaches to network addressing.  Lack of guidelines on handling this aspect of network design could slow down the deployment and integration of IPv6.  This document aims to provide the information and recommendations relevant to planning the addressing aspects of IPv6 deployments.  The document also provides IPv6 addressing case studies for both an enterprise and an ISP network.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
