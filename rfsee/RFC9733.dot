BRSKI with Alternative Enrollment

2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines enhancements to the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol, known as BRSKI with Alternative Enrollment (BRSKI-AE).  BRSKI-AE extends BRSKI to support certificate enrollment mechanisms instead of the originally specified use of Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST).  It supports certificate enrollment protocols such as the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) that use authenticated self-contained signed objects for certification messages, allowing for flexibility in network device onboarding scenarios.  The enhancements address use cases where the existing enrollment mechanism may not be feasible or optimal, providing a framework for integrating suitable alternative enrollment protocols.  This document also updates the BRSKI reference architecture to accommodate these alternative methods, ensuring secure and scalable deployment across a range of network environments.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
Infrastructure (BRSKI)
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8995.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic Control Plane.  To do this, a Secure Key Infrastructure is bootstrapped.  This is done using manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing service, both online and offline.  We call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol.  Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks.  Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included.  Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well."];
