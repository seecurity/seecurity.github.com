Port Management to Reduce Logging in
Large-Scale NATs
2016", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Various IPv6 transition strategies require the introduction of large- scale NATs (e.g., AFTR and NAT64) to share the limited supply of IPv4 addresses available in the network until transition is complete.  There has recently been debate over how to manage the sharing of ports between different subscribers sharing the same IPv4 address.  One factor in the discussion is the operational requirement to log the assignment of transport addresses to subscribers.  It has been argued that dynamic assignment of individual ports between subscribers requires the generation of an excessive volume of logs.  This document suggests a way to achieve dynamic port sharing while keeping log volumes low.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Issues with IP Address Sharing
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6269.html", target="_top", tooltip="The completion of IPv4 address allocations from IANA and the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) is causing service providers around the world to question how they will continue providing IPv4 connectivity service to their subscribers when there are no longer sufficient IPv4 addresses to allocate them one per subscriber. Several possible solutions to this problem are now emerging based around the idea of shared IPv4 addressing. These solutions give rise to a number of issues, and this memo identifies those common to all such address sharing approaches. Such issues include application failures, additional service monitoring complexity, new security vulnerabilities, and so on. Solution-specific discussions are out of scope. Deploying IPv6 is the only perennial way to ease pressure on the public IPv4 address pool without the need for address sharing mechanisms that give rise to the issues identified herein.

Recommendations for Transport-Protocol
Port Randomization
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6056.html", target="_top", tooltip="During the last few years, awareness has been raised about a number of blind attacks that can be performed against the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and similar protocols.  The consequences of these attacks range from throughput reduction to broken connections or data corruption.  These attacks rely on the attacker's ability to guess or know the five-tuple (Protocol, Source Address, Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port) that identifies the transport protocol instance to be attacked.  This document describes a number of simple and efficient methods for the selection of the client port number, such that the possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced.  While this is not a replacement for cryptographic methods for protecting the transport-protocol instance, the aforementioned port selection algorithms provide improved security with very little effort and without any key management overhead.  The algorithms described in this document are local policies that may be incrementally deployed and that do not violate the specifications of any of the transport protocols that may benefit from them, such as TCP, UDP, UDP-lite, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), and RTP (provided that the RTP application explicitly signals the RTP and RTCP port numbers).  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice."];
