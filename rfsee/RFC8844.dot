Unknown Key-Share Attacks on Uses of TLS

Similar attacks are described on the use of DTLS-SRTP with the identity bindings used in Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) and SIP identity.  These attacks are difficult to mount, but they cause a victim to be misled about the identity of a communicating peer.

Connection-Oriented Media Transport over
the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Protocol in the Session Description
Protocol (SDP)
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8122.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies how to establish secure connection-oriented media transport sessions over the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol using the Session Description Protocol (SDP). It defines the SDP protocol identifier, 'TCP/TLS'. It also defines the syntax and semantics for an SDP 'fingerprint' attribute that identifies the certificate that will be presented for the TLS session. This mechanism allows media transport over TLS connections to be established securely, so long as the integrity of session descriptions is assured. This document obsoletes RFC 4572 by clarifying the usage of multiple fingerprints."];
