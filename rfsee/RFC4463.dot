A Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP)
Developed by Cisco, Nuance, and
Speechworks
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) that was developed jointly by Cisco Systems, Inc., Nuance Communications, and Speechworks, Inc. It is published as an RFC as input for further IETF development in this area. MRCP controls media service resources like speech synthesizers, recognizers, signal generators, signal detectors, fax servers, etc., over a network. This protocol is designed to work with streaming protocols like RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) or SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), which help establish control connections to external media streaming devices, and media delivery mechanisms like RTP (Real Time Protocol). This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Media Resource Control Protocol Version
2 (MRCPv2)
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6787.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) allows client hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers, recognizers, verifiers, and identifiers residing in servers on the network.  MRCPv2 is not a stand-alone protocol -- it relies on other protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe, discover, and exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the media source or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above, allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the speech resource server.
