BSR is one way that a multicast router can learn the set of group-to-RP mappings required in order to function.  The mechanism is dynamic, largely self-configuring, and robust to router failure.

It is the companion document to A Set of Possible Requirements for a Future Routing Architecture (RFC 5772), which is a discussion of requirements for the future routing architecture, addressing systems developments and future routing protocols.  This document summarizes discussions held several years ago by members of the IRTF Routing Research Group (IRTF RRG) and other interested parties.  The document is published with the support of the IRTF RRG as a record of the work completed at that time, but with the understanding that it does not necessarily represent either the latest technical understanding or the technical consensus of the research group at the date of publication.
