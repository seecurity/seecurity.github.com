Comments on the Usefulness of Simple
Best-Effort Traffic
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document presents some observations on simple best-effort traffic, defined loosely for the purposes of this document as Internet traffic that is not covered by Quality of Service (QOS) mechanisms, congestion-based pricing, cost-based fairness, admissions control, or the like.  One observation is that simple best-effort traffic serves a useful role in the Internet, and is worth keeping.  While differential treatment of traffic can clearly be useful, we believe such mechanisms are useful as *adjuncts* to simple best- effort traffic, not as *replacements* of simple best-effort traffic.  A second observation is that for simple best-effort traffic, some form of rough flow-rate fairness is a useful goal for resource allocation, where flow-rate fairness is defined by the goal of equal flow rates for different flows over the same path.

IAB Concerns Regarding Congestion
Control for Voice Traffic in the
Internet
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3714.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses IAB concerns about effective end-to-end congestion control for best-effort voice traffic in the Internet.  These concerns have to do with fairness, user quality, and with the dangers of congestion collapse.  The concerns are particularly relevant in light of the absence of a widespread Quality of Service (QoS) deployment in the Internet, and the likelihood that this situation will not change much in the near term.  This document is not making any recommendations about deployment paths for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in terms of QoS support, and is not claiming that best-effort service can be relied upon to give acceptable performance for VoIP.  We are merely observing that voice traffic is occasionally deployed as best-effort traffic over some links in the Internet, that we expect this occasional deployment to continue, and that we have concerns about the lack of effective end-to-end congestion control for this best-effort voice traffic.

Metrics for the Evaluation of Congestion
Control Mechanisms
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5166.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses the metrics to be considered in an evaluation of new or modified congestion control mechanisms for the Internet. These include metrics for the evaluation of new transport protocols, of proposed modifications to TCP, of application-level congestion control, and of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms in the router. This document is the first in a series of documents aimed at improving the models that we use in the evaluation of transport protocols. This document is a product of the Transport Modeling Research Group (TMRG), and has received detailed feedback from many members of the Research Group (RG). As the document tries to make clear, there is not necessarily a consensus within the research community (or the IETF community, the vendor community, the operations community, or any other community) about the metrics that congestion control mechanisms should be designed to optimize, in terms of trade-offs between throughput and delay, fairness between competing flows, and the like. However, we believe that there is a clear consensus that congestion control mechanisms should be evaluated in terms of trade-offs between a range of metrics, rather than in terms of optimizing for a single metric.

A Lower Effort Per-Domain Behavior (PDB)
for Differentiated Services
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3662.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document proposes a differentiated services per-domain behavior (PDB) whose traffic may be starved (although starvation is not strictly required) in a properly functioning network.  This is in contrast to the Internet's best-effort or normal Internet traffic model, where prolonged starvation indicates network problems.  In this sense, the proposed PDB's traffic is forwarded with a lower priority than the normal best-effort Internet traffic, thus the PDB is called Lower Effort (LE).  Use of this PDB permits a network operator to strictly limit the effect of its traffic on best-effort/normal or all other Internet traffic.  This document gives some example uses, but does not propose constraining the PDB's use to any particular type of traffic."];
