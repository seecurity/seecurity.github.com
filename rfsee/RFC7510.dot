Currently, the payload of a packet entering the Softwire can only be interpreted by the ingress and egress routers.  Thus, the load-balancing decision of a core router is only based on the encapsulating header, presenting much less entropy than available in the payload or the encapsulated header since the Softwire encapsulation acts in a tunneling fashion.
