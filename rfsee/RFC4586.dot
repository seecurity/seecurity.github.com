Extended RTP Profile for Real-time
Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based
Feedback: Results of the Timing Rule
Simulations

Unicast and multicast topologies are considered as well as several protocol and environment configurations.  The results show that the timing rules result in better performance regarding feedback delay and still preserve the well-accepted RTP rules regarding allowed bit rates for control traffic.
