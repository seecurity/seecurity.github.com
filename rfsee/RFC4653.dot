Improving the Robustness of TCP to Non-
Congestion Events
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document specifies Non-Congestion Robustness (NCR) for TCP.  In the absence of explicit congestion notification from the network, TCP uses loss as an indication of congestion.  One of the ways TCP detects loss is using the arrival of three duplicate acknowledgments.  However, this heuristic is not always correct, notably in the case when network paths reorder segments (for whatever reason), resulting in degraded performance.  TCP-NCR is designed to mitigate this degraded performance by increasing the number of duplicate acknowledgments required to trigger loss recovery, based on the current state of the connection, in an effort to better disambiguate true segment loss from segment reordering.  This document specifies the changes to TCP, as well as the costs and benefits of these modifications.

This document describes the F-RTO detection algorithm for detecting spurious TCP retransmission timeouts.  F-RTO is a TCP sender-only algorithm that does not require any TCP options to operate.  After retransmitting the first unacknowledged segment triggered by a timeout, the F-RTO algorithm of the TCP sender monitors the incoming acknowledgments to determine whether the timeout was spurious.  It then decides whether to send new segments or retransmit unacknowledged segments.  The algorithm effectively helps to avoid additional unnecessary retransmissions and thereby improves TCP performance in the case of a spurious timeout.

The document specifies an end-to-end acknowledgement congestion control mechanism for TCP that uses participation from both TCP hosts: the TCP data sender and the TCP data receiver.

The TCP data receiver sends roughly one ACK packet for every R data packets received.
