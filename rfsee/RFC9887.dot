TACACS+ is a protocol used for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) in networked environments. The original TACACS+ protocol does not mandate the use of encryption or secure transport. This specification defines a profile for using TLS 1.3 with TACACS+, including guidance on authentication, connection establishment, and operational considerations. The goal is to enhance the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of TACACS+ traffic, aligning the protocol with modern security best practices.
