YANG Module Classification
2017", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The YANG data modeling language is currently being considered for a wide variety of applications throughout the networking industry at large. Many standards development organizations (SDOs), open-source software projects, vendors, and users are using YANG to develop and publish YANG modules for a wide variety of applications. At the same time, there is currently no well-known terminology to categorize various types of YANG modules. A consistent terminology would help with the categorization of YANG modules, assist in the analysis of the YANG data modeling efforts in the IETF and other organizations, and bring clarity to the YANG- related discussions between the different groups. This document describes a set of concepts and associated terms to support consistent classification of YANG modules.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

The YANG 1.1 Data Modeling Language

YANG Data Model for L3VPN Service

This document is limited to BGP PE-based VPNs as described in RFCs 4026, 4110, and 4364.  This model is intended to be instantiated at the management system to deliver the overall service.  It is not a configuration model to be used directly on network elements.  This model provides an abstracted view of the Layer 3 IP VPN service configuration components.  It will be up to the management system to take this model as input and use specific configuration models to configure the different network elements to deliver the service.  How the configuration of network elements is done is out of scope for this document."];

Service Models Explained
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8309.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IETF has produced many modules in the YANG modeling language. The majority of these modules are used to construct data models to model devices or monolithic functions. A small number of YANG modules have been defined to model services (for example, the Layer 3 Virtual Private Network Service Model (L3SM) produced by the L3SM working group and documented in RFC 8049). This document describes service models as used within the IETF and also shows where a service model might fit into a software-defined networking architecture. Note that service models do not make any assumption of how a service is actually engineered and delivered for a customer; details of how network protocols and devices are engineered to deliver a service are captured in other modules that are not exposed through the interface between the customer and the provider."];

A Framework for Automating Service and
Network Management with YANG
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8969.html", target="_top", tooltip="Data models provide a programmatic approach to represent services and networks. Concretely, they can be used to derive configuration information for network and service components, and state information that will be monitored and tracked. Data models can be used during the service and network management life cycle (e.g., service instantiation, service provisioning, service optimization, service monitoring, service diagnosing, and service assurance). Data models are also instrumental in the automation of network management, and they can provide closed-loop control for adaptive and deterministic service creation, delivery, and maintenance. This document describes a framework for service and network management automation that takes advantage of YANG modeling technologies. This framework is drawn from a network operator perspective irrespective of the origin of a data model; thus, it can accommodate YANG modules that are developed outside the IETF."];

This architecture not only helps to correlate the service degradation with symptoms of a specific network component but, it also lists the services impacted by the failure or degradation of a specific network component."];

Delay-Tolerant Networking Management

The unique characteristics of this environment require a unique approach to network management that supports asynchronous transport, autonomous local control, and a small footprint (in both resources and dependencies) so as to deploy on constrained devices. This document describes a DTN Management Architecture (DTNMA) suitable for managing devices in any challenged environment but, in particular, those communicating using the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP). Operating over BP requires an architecture that neither presumes synchronized transport behavior nor relies on query-response mechanisms. Implementations compliant with this DTNMA should expect to successfully operate in extremely challenging conditions, such as over unidirectional links and other places where BP is the preferred transport."];
