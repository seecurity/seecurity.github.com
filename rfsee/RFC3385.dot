Interface (iSCSI)

The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with the standardized SCSI architecture model.  SCSI is a popular family of protocols that enable systems to communicate with I/O devices, especially storage devices.  SCSI protocols are request/response application protocols with a common standardized architecture model and basic command set, as well as standardized command sets for different device classes (disks, tapes, media-changers etc.).  As system interconnects move from the classical bus structure to a network structure, SCSI has to be mapped to network transport protocols.  IP networks now meet the performance requirements of fast system interconnects and as such are good candidates to carry SCSI. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with the standardized SCSI Architecture Model (SAM-2). RFC 3720 defined the original iSCSI protocol. RFC 3721 discusses iSCSI naming examples and discovery techniques. Subsequently, RFC 3980 added an additional naming format to the iSCSI protocol. RFC 4850 followed up by adding a new public extension key to iSCSI. RFC 5048 offered a number of clarifications as well as a few improvements and corrections to the original iSCSI protocol. This document obsoletes RFCs 3720, 3980, 4850, and 5048 by consolidating them into a single document and making additional updates to the consolidated specification. This document also updates RFC 3721. The text in this document thus supersedes the text in all the noted RFCs wherever there is a difference in semantics."];
