Considerations around Transport Header
Confidentiality, Network Operations, and
the Evolution of Internet Transport
Protocols
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9065.html", target="_top", tooltip="To protect user data and privacy, Internet transport protocols have supported payload encryption and authentication for some time. Such encryption and authentication are now also starting to be applied to the transport protocol headers. This helps avoid transport protocol ossification by middleboxes, mitigate attacks against the transport protocol, and protect metadata about the communication. Current operational practice in some networks inspect transport header information within the network, but this is no longer possible when those transport headers are encrypted. This document discusses the possible impact when network traffic uses a protocol with an encrypted transport header. It suggests issues to consider when designing new transport protocols or features."];

Measurements Techniques

These methods employ just a few marking bits inside the header of each packet for performance measurements and require the client and server to collaborate.  Both endpoints cooperate by marking packets and, possibly, mirroring the markings on the round-trip connection.  The techniques are especially valuable when applied to protocols that encrypt transport headers since they enable loss and delay measurements by passive, on-path network devices.  This document describes several methods that can be used separately or jointly depending of the availability of marking bits, desired measurements, and properties of the protocol to which the methods are applied."];
