Using a Dedicated AS for Sites  Homed to
a Single Provider
1998", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="With the increased growth of the Internet, the number of customers using BGP4 has grown significantly.  RFC1930 outlines a set of guidelines for when one needs and should use an AS.  However, the customer and service provider (ISP) are left with a problem as a result of this in that while there is no need for an allocated AS under the guidelines, certain conditions make the use of BGP4 a very pragmatic and perhaps only way to connect a customer homed to a single ISP.  This paper proposes a solution to this problem in line with recommendations set forth in RFC1930.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
