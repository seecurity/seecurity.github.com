A Common Operational Problem in DNS
Servers: Failure to Communicate

Failing to respond to queries, or responding incorrectly, causes both immediate operational problems and long-term problems with protocol development. This document identifies a number of common kinds of queries to which some servers either fail to respond or respond incorrectly. This document also suggests procedures for zone operators to apply to identify and remediate the problem. The document does not look at the DNS data itself, just the structure of the responses."];

DNS Zone Transfer Protocol (AXFR)

Authoritative Transfer (AXFR) is one of the mechanisms and is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035. The definition of AXFR has proven insufficient in detail, thereby forcing implementations intended to be compliant to make assumptions, impeding interoperability. Yet today we have a satisfactory set of implementations that do interoperate.
