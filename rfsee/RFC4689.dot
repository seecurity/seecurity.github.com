Terminology for Benchmarking Network-
layer Traffic Control Mechanisms
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes terminology for the benchmarking of devices that implement traffic control using packet classification based on defined criteria.  The terminology is to be applied to measurements made on the data plane to evaluate IP traffic control mechanisms.  Rules for packet classification can be based on any field in the IP header, such as the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), or any field in the packet payload, such as port number.

Assessing the Impact of Carrier-Grade
NAT on Network Applications
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7021.html", target="_top", tooltip="NAT444 is an IPv4 extension technology being considered by Service Providers as a means to continue offering IPv4 service to customers while transitioning to IPv6.  This technology adds an extra Carrier- Grade NAT (CGN) in the Service Provider network, often resulting in two NATs.  CableLabs, Time Warner Cable, and Rogers Communications independently tested the impacts of NAT444 on many popular Internet services using a variety of test scenarios, network topologies, and vendor equipment.  This document identifies areas where adding a second layer of NAT disrupts the communication channel for common Internet applications.  This document was updated to include the Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) impacts also."];
