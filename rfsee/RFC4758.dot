Cryptographic Token Key Initialization
Protocol (CT-KIP) Version 1.0 Revision 1
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document constitutes Revision 1 of Cryptographic Token Key Initialization Protocol (CT-KIP) Version 1.0 from RSA Laboratories' One-Time Password Specifications (OTPS) series. The body of this document, except for the intellectual property considerations section, is taken from the CT-KIP Version 1.0 document, but comments received during the IETF review are reflected; hence, the status of a revised version. As no bits-on-the-wire have changed, the protocol specified herein is compatible with CT-KIP Version 1.0. CT-KIP is a client-server protocol for initialization (and configuration) of cryptographic tokens. The protocol requires neither private-key capabilities in the cryptographic tokens, nor an established public-key infrastructure. Provisioned (or generated) secrets will only be available to the server and the cryptographic token itself.

Inter-AS Requirements for the Path
Computation Element Communication
Protocol (PCECP)
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5376.html", target="_top", tooltip="Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineered (MPLS TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be established wholly within an Autonomous System (AS) or may cross AS boundaries. The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a component that is capable of computing constrained paths for (G)MPLS TE LSPs. The PCE Communication Protocol (PCECP) is defined to allow communication between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs, as well as between PCEs. The PCECP is used to request constrained paths and to supply computed paths in response. Generic requirements for the PCECP are set out in Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements, RFC 4657. This document extends those requirements to cover the use of PCECP in support of inter-AS MPLS TE. This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Dynamic Symmetric Key Provisioning
Protocol (DSKPP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6063.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Dynamic Symmetric Key Provisioning Protocol (DSKPP) is a client-server protocol for initialization (and configuration) of symmetric keys to locally and remotely accessible cryptographic modules. The protocol can be run with or without private key capabilities in the cryptographic modules and with or without an established public key infrastructure. Two variations of the protocol support multiple usage scenarios. With the four-pass variant, keys are mutually generated by the provisioning server and cryptographic module; provisioned keys are not transferred over-the-wire or over-the-air. The two-pass variant enables secure and efficient download and installation of pre-generated symmetric keys to a cryptographic module. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
