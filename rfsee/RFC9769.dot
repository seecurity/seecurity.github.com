NTP Interleaved Modes

This document describes NTP version 4 (NTPv4), which is backwards compatible with NTP version 3 (NTPv3), described in RFC 1305, as well as previous versions of the protocol.  NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family.  NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs.  It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not required.  It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism."];

Network Time Protocol Version 4: Autokey
Specification
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5906.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo describes the Autokey security model for authenticating servers to clients using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and public key cryptography. Its design is based on the premise that IPsec schemes cannot be adopted intact, since that would preclude stateless servers and severely compromise timekeeping accuracy. In addition, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) schemes presume authenticated time values are always available to enforce certificate lifetimes; however, cryptographically verified timestamps require interaction between the timekeeping and authentication functions. This memo includes the Autokey requirements analysis, design principles, and protocol specification. A detailed description of the protocol states, events, and transition functions is included. A prototype of the Autokey design based on this memo has been implemented, tested, and documented in the NTP version 4 (NTPv4) software distribution for the Unix, Windows, and Virtual Memory System (VMS) operating systems at http://www.ntp.org.

Network Time Protocol Version 4: Port
Randomization
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9109.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Network Time Protocol (NTP) can operate in several modes.  Some of these modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets and therefore require the use of a well-known port as the local port.  However, in the case of NTP modes where the use of a well-known port is not required, employing such a well-known port unnecessarily facilitates the ability of attackers to perform blind/off-path attacks.  This document formally updates RFC 5905, recommending the use of transport-protocol ephemeral port randomization for those modes where use of the NTP well-known port is not required."];
