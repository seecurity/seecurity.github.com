Multiple Care-of Addresses Registration
2009", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="According to the current Mobile IPv6 specification, a mobile node may have several care-of addresses but only one, called the primary care-of address, can be registered with its home agent and the correspondent nodes.  However, for matters of cost, bandwidth, delay, etc, it is useful for the mobile node to get Internet access through multiple accesses simultaneously, in which case the mobile node would be configured with multiple active IPv6 care-of addresses.  This document proposes extensions to the Mobile IPv6 protocol to register and use multiple care-of addresses.  The extensions proposed in this document can be used by mobile routers using the NEMO (Network Mobility) Basic Support protocol as well. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

Mobility Support in IPv6
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3775.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a protocol which allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5568.html", target="_top", tooltip="Mobile IPv6 enables a mobile node (MN) to maintain its connectivity to the Internet when moving from one Access Router to another, a process referred to as handover. During handover, there is a period during which the mobile node is unable to send or receive packets because of link-switching delay and IP protocol operations. This handover latency resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures (namely, movement detection, new Care-of Address configuration, and Binding Update) is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP (VoIP). Reducing the handover latency could be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as well. This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures. This document does not address improving the link-switching latency.
