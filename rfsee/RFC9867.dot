Mixing Preshared Keys in the
IKE_INTERMEDIATE and CREATE_CHILD_SA
Exchanges of the Internet Key Exchange
Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) for Post-
Quantum Security
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="An Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) extension defined in RFC 8784 allows IPsec traffic to be protected against someone storing VPN communications and decrypting them later, when (and if) a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) is available. The protection is achieved by means of a Post-quantum Preshared Key (PPK) that is mixed into the session keys calculation. However, this protection does not cover an initial IKEv2 Security Association (SA), which might be unacceptable in some scenarios. This specification defines an alternative way to provide protection against quantum computers, which is similar to the solution defined in RFC 8784, but it also protects the initial IKEv2 SA. RFC 8784 assumes that PPKs are static and thus they are only used when an initial IKEv2 SA is created. If a fresh PPK is available before the IKE SA expires, then the only way to use it is to delete the current IKE SA and create a new one from scratch, which is inefficient. This specification defines a way to use PPKs in active IKEv2 SAs for creating additional IPsec SAs and rekey operations.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

for Post-quantum Security

The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) is one example of a cryptosystem that could be broken; someone storing VPN communications today could decrypt them at a later time when a quantum computer is available.  It is anticipated that IKEv2 will be extended to support quantum-secure key exchange algorithms; however, that is not likely to happen in the near term.  To address this problem before then, this document describes an extension of IKEv2 to allow it to be resistant to a quantum computer by using preshared keys."];

Intermediate Exchange in the Internet

This exchange can be used for transferring large amounts of data in the process of IKEv2 Security Association (SA) establishment.  An example of the need to do this is using key exchange methods resistant to Quantum Computers (QCs) for IKE SA establishment.  The Intermediate Exchange makes it possible to use the existing IKE fragmentation mechanism (which cannot be used in the initial IKEv2 exchange), helping to avoid IP fragmentation of large IKE messages if they need to be sent before IKEv2 SA is established."];

This document utilizes the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchange, where multiple key exchanges are performed when an IKE SA is being established. It also introduces a new IKEv2 exchange, IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE, which is used for the same purpose when the IKE SA is being rekeyed or is creating additional Child SAs. This document updates RFC 7296 by renaming a Transform Type 4 from Diffie-Hellman Group (D-H) to Key Exchange Method (KE) and renaming a field in the Key Exchange Payload from Diffie-Hellman Group Num to Key Exchange Method. It also renames an IANA registry for this Transform Type from Transform Type 4 - Diffie- Hellman Group Transform IDs to Transform Type 4 - Key Exchange Method Transform IDs.
