Mark and Signed Mark Objects Mapping

This document describes the format of a mark and a digitally signed mark used by trademark holders for registering domain names during the Sunrise Period of generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs). Three types of Mark objects are defined in this specification: registered trademarks, court-validated marks, and marks protected by statue or treaty.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
