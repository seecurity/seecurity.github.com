Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA):
Overview and Requirements
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines the problem statement, scope, and protocol requirements between the components of the NEA (Network Endpoint Assessment) reference model.  NEA provides owners of networks (e.g., an enterprise offering remote access) a mechanism to evaluate the posture of a system.  This may take place during the request for network access and/or subsequently at any time while connected to the network.  The learned posture information can then be applied to a variety of compliance-oriented decisions.  The posture information is frequently useful for detecting systems that are lacking or have out-of-date security protection mechanisms such as: anti-virus and host-based firewall software.  In order to provide context for the requirements, a reference model and terminology are introduced.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

An EAP Authentication Method Based on

Protocol

This document defines an authentication mechanism for EAP called EAP-EKE, based on the Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) protocol.  This method provides mutual authentication through the use of a short, easy to remember password.  Compared with other common authentication methods, EAP-EKE is not susceptible to dictionary attacks.  Neither does it require the availability of public-key certificates.

We call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol.  Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks.  Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included.  Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well."];
