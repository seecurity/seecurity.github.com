An Automatic Certificate Management
Environment (ACME) Profile for
Generating Delegated Certificates
2021", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines a profile of the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol by which the holder of an identifier (e.g., a domain name) can allow a third party to obtain an X.509 certificate such that the certificate subject is the delegated identifier while the certified public key corresponds to a private key controlled by the third party.  A primary use case is that of a Content Delivery Network (CDN), the third party, terminating TLS sessions on behalf of a content provider (the holder of a domain name).  The presented mechanism allows the holder of the identifier to retain control over the delegation and revoke it at any time.  Importantly, this mechanism does not require any modification to the deployed TLS clients and servers.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Support for Short-Term, Automatically

Environment (ACME)
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8739.html", target="_top", tooltip="Public key certificates need to be revoked when they are compromised, that is, when the associated private key is exposed to an unauthorized entity.  However, the revocation process is often unreliable.  An alternative to revocation is issuing a sequence of certificates, each with a short validity period, and terminating the sequence upon compromise.  This memo proposes an Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) extension to enable the issuance of Short-Term, Automatically Renewed (STAR) X.509 certificates."];

Automatic Certificate Management
Environment (ACME)

Thus, certification authorities (CAs) in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.  As of this writing, this verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms.  This document describes a protocol that a CA and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance.  The protocol also provides facilities for other certificate management functions, such as certificate revocation."];
