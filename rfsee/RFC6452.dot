Stringprep Revision and Problem
Statement for the Preparation and
Comparison of Internationalized Strings
(PRECIS)
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6885.html", target="_top", tooltip="If a protocol expects to compare two strings and is prepared only for those strings to be ASCII, then using Unicode code points in those strings requires they be prepared somehow.  Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (here called IDNA2003) defined and used Stringprep and Nameprep.  Other protocols subsequently defined Stringprep profiles.  A new approach different from Stringprep and Nameprep is used for a revision of IDNA2003 (called IDNA2008).  Other Stringprep profiles need to be similarly updated, or a replacement of Stringprep needs to be designed.  This document outlines the issues to be faced by those designing a Stringprep replacement."];

This document defines a framework enabling application protocols to perform the preparation, enforcement, and comparison of internationalized strings (PRECIS) in a way that depends on the properties of Unicode characters and thus is agile with respect to versions of Unicode.

Internationalized Domain Names for
Applications (IDNA) Review for New
Unicode Versions
2020", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8753.html", target="_top", tooltip="The standards for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) require a review of each new version of Unicode to determine whether incompatibilities with prior versions or other issues exist and, where appropriate, to allow the IETF to decide on the trade-offs between compatibility with prior IDNA versions and compatibility with Unicode going forward.  That requirement, and its relationship to tables maintained by IANA, has caused significant confusion in the past.  This document makes adjustments to the review procedure based on experience and updates IDNA, specifically RFC 5892, to reflect those changes and to clarify the various relationships involved.  It also makes other minor adjustments to align that document with experience."];

IDNA2008 allows adding exceptions to the algorithm for backward compatibility; however, this document does not add any such exceptions.
