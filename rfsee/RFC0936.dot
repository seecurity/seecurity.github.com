Another Internet subnet addressing
scheme
1985", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="There have been several proposals for schemes to allow the use of a single Internet network number to refer to a collection of physical networks under common administration which are reachable from the rest of the Internet by a common route.  Such schemes allow a simplified view of an otherwise complicated topology from hosts and gateways outside of this collection.  They allow the complexity of the number and type of these networks, and routing to them, to be localized.  Additions and changes in configuration thus cause no detectable change, and no interruption of service, due to slow propagation of routing and other information outside of the local environment.  These schemes also simplify the administration of the network, as changes do not require allocation of new network numbers for each new cable installed.  This proposal discusses an alternative scheme, one that has been in use at the University of California, Berkeley since April 1984.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
