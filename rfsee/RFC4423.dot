Host Identity Protocol

HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes.  HIP is based on a Sigma-compliant Diffie- Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.  The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the- middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional encryption for upper- layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.

NAT and Firewall Traversal Issues of
Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
Communication
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5207.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) changes the way in which two Internet hosts communicate.  One key advantage over other schemes is that HIP does not require modifications to the traditional network- layer functionality of the Internet, i.e., its routers.  In the current Internet, however, many devices other than routers modify the traditional network-layer behavior of the Internet.  These middleboxes are intermediary devices that perform functions other than the standard functions of an IP router on the datagram path between source and destination hosts.  Whereas some types of middleboxes may not interfere with HIP at all, others can affect some aspects of HIP communication, and others can render HIP communication impossible.  This document discusses the problems associated with HIP communication across network paths that include specific types of middleboxes, namely, network address translators and firewalls.  It identifies and discusses issues in the current HIP specifications that affect communication across these types of middleboxes.  This document is a product of the IRTF HIP Research Group.

This information provides advice to the other end of the TCP connection to adapt its user timeout accordingly.  Increasing the user timeouts on both ends of a TCP connection allows it to survive extended periods without end-to-end connectivity.  Decreasing the user timeouts allows busy servers to explicitly notify their clients that they will maintain the connection state only for a short time without connectivity. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Routing and Addressing in Networks with
Global Enterprise Recursion (RANGER)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5720.html", target="_top", tooltip="RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing in networks with global enterprise recursion.  The term enterprise network within this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and deployment scenarios, where an enterprise can be as small as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) network, as dynamic as a Mobile Ad Hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational corporation, or as large as the global Internet itself.  Such networks will require an architected solution for the coordination of routing and addressing plans with accommodations for scalability, provider-independence, mobility, multihoming, and security.  These considerations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the same principles apply even for clean-slate approaches.

Hierarchical IPv4 Framework

In the future, the ELOC space will only be significant in a private network or in a service provider domain. Therefore, a 32x32 bit addressing scheme and a hierarchical routing architecture are achieved. The hierarchical IPv4 framework is backwards compatible with the current IPv4 Internet. This document also discusses a method for decoupling the location and identifier functions -- future applications can make use of the separation. The framework requires extensions to the existing Domain Name System (DNS), the existing IPv4 stack of the endpoints, middleboxes, and routers in the Internet. The framework can be implemented incrementally for endpoints, DNS, middleboxes, and routers. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];
