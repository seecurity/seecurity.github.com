EAP-IKEv2 provides mutual authentication and session key establishment between an EAP peer and an EAP server.  It supports authentication techniques that are based on passwords, high-entropy shared keys, and public key certificates.  EAP-IKEv2 further provides support for cryptographic ciphersuite negotiation, hash function agility, identity confidentiality (in certain modes of operation), fragmentation, and an optional fast reconnect mode.

If the shared key can be derived from the IKEv2 SA, OWAMP or TWAMP can support certificate-based key exchange; this would allow for more operational flexibility and efficiency.

Mixing Preshared Keys in the Internet

for Post-quantum Security

The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) is one example of a cryptosystem that could be broken; someone storing VPN communications today could decrypt them at a later time when a quantum computer is available.  It is anticipated that IKEv2 will be extended to support quantum-secure key exchange algorithms; however, that is not likely to happen in the near term.  To address this problem before then, this document describes an extension of IKEv2 to allow it to be resistant to a quantum computer by using preshared keys."];

Multiple Key Exchanges in the Internet
Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)

This document utilizes the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchange, where multiple key exchanges are performed when an IKE SA is being established. It also introduces a new IKEv2 exchange, IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE, which is used for the same purpose when the IKE SA is being rekeyed or is creating additional Child SAs. This document updates RFC 7296 by renaming a Transform Type 4 from Diffie-Hellman Group (D-H) to Key Exchange Method (KE) and renaming a field in the Key Exchange Payload from Diffie-Hellman Group Num to Key Exchange Method. It also renames an IANA registry for this Transform Type from Transform Type 4 - Diffie- Hellman Group Transform IDs to Transform Type 4 - Key Exchange Method Transform IDs. These changes generalize key exchange algorithms that can be used in IKEv2."];
