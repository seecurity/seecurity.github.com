Mtrace Version 2: Traceroute Facility
for IP Multicast
2018", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes the IP multicast traceroute facility, named Mtrace version 2 (Mtrace2).  Unlike unicast traceroute, Mtrace2 requires special implementations on the part of routers.  This specification describes the required functionality in multicast routers, as well as how an Mtrace2 client invokes a Query and receives a Reply."];

CCNinfo: Discovering Content and Network
Information in Content-Centric Networks
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9344.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism named CCNinfo that discovers information about the network topology and in-network cache in Content-Centric Networks (CCNs). CCNinfo investigates 1) the CCN routing path information per name prefix, 2) the Round-Trip Time (RTT) between the content forwarder and the consumer, and 3) the states of in-network cache per name prefix. CCNinfo is useful to understand and debug the behavior of testbed networks and other experimental deployments of CCN systems. This document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG). This document represents the consensus view of ICNRG and has been reviewed extensively by several members of the ICN community and the RG. The authors and RG chairs approve of the contents. The document is sponsored under the IRTF, is not issued by the IETF, and is not an IETF standard. This is an experimental protocol and the specification may change in the future."];

Multicast On-Path Telemetry Using In

2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9630.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies two solutions to meet the requirements of on-path telemetry for multicast traffic using IOAM.  While IOAM is advantageous for multicast traffic telemetry, some unique challenges are present.  This document provides the solutions based on the IOAM trace option and direct export option to support the telemetry data correlation and the multicast tree reconstruction without incurring data redundancy."];

Multicast-Only Fast Reroute (MoFRR)
Based on Topology Independent Loop-Free
Alternate (TI-LFA) Fast Reroute
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9860.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies the use of Topology Independent Loop-Free Alternate (TI-LFA) mechanisms with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR) for Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM).  The TI-LFA provides Fast Reroute (FRR) protection for unicast traffic in IP networks by precomputing backup paths that avoid potential failures.  By integrating TI-LFA with MoFRR, this document extends the benefits of FRR mechanisms to multicast traffic, enabling enhanced resilience and minimized packet loss in multicast networks.  The document outlines an optional approach to implement TI-LFA in conjunction with MoFRR for PIM, ensuring that multicast traffic is rapidly rerouted in the event of a failure."];
