Domain administrators guide

The domain-naming system is distributed and hierarchical.  This memo describes procedures for registering a domain with the Network Information Center (NIC) of Defense Data Network (DDN), and offers guidelines on the establishment and administration of a domain in accordance with the requirements specified in RFC-920.  It is recommended that the guidelines described in this document be used by domain administrators in the establishment and control of second-level domains.  The role of the domain administrator (DA) is that of coordinator, manager, and technician.  If his domain is established at the second level or lower in the tree, the domain administrator must register by interacting with the management of the domain directly above this."];

This document describes how the TLS Transport Model (TLSTM) implements the needed features of a SNMP Transport Subsystem to make this protection possible in an interoperable way. This Transport Model is designed to meet the security and operational needs of network administrators. It supports the sending of SNMP messages over TLS/TCP and DTLS/UDP. The TLS mode can make use of TCP's improved support for larger packet sizes and the DTLS mode provides potentially superior operation in environments where a connectionless (e.g., UDP) transport is preferred. Both TLS and DTLS integrate well into existing public keying infrastructures. This document also defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols.

This specification defines how CoAP should be used in a group communication context.
