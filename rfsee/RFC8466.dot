We call this simplified type of VPLS an IP-only LAN Service (IPLS). In an IPLS, as in a VPLS, LAN interfaces are run in promiscuous mode, and frames are forwarded based on their destination Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. However, the maintenance of the MAC forwarding tables is done via signaling, rather than via the MAC address learning procedures specified in the IEEE's Media Access Control (MAC) Bridges. This document specifies the protocol extensions and procedures for support of the IPLS service. The original intent was to provide an alternate solution to VPLS for those Provider Edge (PE) routers that were not capable of learning MAC addresses through data plane.

A YANG Data Model for Augmenting VPN
Service and Network Models with
Attachment Circuits
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9836.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a YANG data model, referred to as the AC Glue
model, to augment the LxVPN Service Model (LxSM) and LxVPN Network
Model (LxNM) with references to attachment circuits (ACs).  The AC
Glue model enables a provider to associate Layer 2/3 VPN (LxVPN)
services with the underlying AC infrastructure, thereby facilitating
consistent provisioning and management of new or existing ACs in
conjunction with LxVPN services.  Specifically, by introducing an
integrated approach to AC and LxVPN management, this model supports
Attachment Circuit as a Service (ACaaS) and provides a standardized
mechanism for aligning AC/VPN requests with the network
configurations required to deliver them."];

A Realization of Network Slices for 5G

Technologies
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9889.html", target="_top", tooltip="Network slicing is a feature that was introduced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in Mobile Networks. Realization of 5G slicing implies requirements for all mobile domains, including the Radio Access Network (RAN), Core Network (CN), and Transport Network (TN). This document describes a network slice realization model for IP/MPLS networks with a focus on the Transport Network fulfilling the service objectives for 5G slicing connectivity. The realization model reuses many building blocks commonly used in service provider networks at the current time."];
