Data models are also instrumental in the automation of network management, and they can provide closed-loop control for adaptive and deterministic service creation, delivery, and maintenance. This document describes a framework for service and network management automation that takes advantage of YANG modeling technologies. This framework is drawn from a network operator perspective irrespective of the origin of a data model; thus, it can accommodate YANG modules that are developed outside the IETF."];

A YANG Data Model for Augmenting VPN
Service and Network Models with
Attachment Circuits
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9836.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a YANG data model, referred to as the AC Glue
model, to augment the LxVPN Service Model (LxSM) and LxVPN Network
Model (LxNM) with references to attachment circuits (ACs).  The AC
Glue model enables a provider to associate Layer 2/3 VPN (LxVPN)
services with the underlying AC infrastructure, thereby facilitating
consistent provisioning and management of new or existing ACs in
conjunction with LxVPN services.  Specifically, by introducing an
integrated approach to AC and LxVPN management, this model supports
Attachment Circuit as a Service (ACaaS) and provides a standardized
mechanism for aligning AC/VPN requests with the network
configurations required to deliver them."];

A Realization of Network Slices for 5G

Realization of 5G slicing implies requirements for all mobile domains, including the Radio Access Network (RAN), Core Network (CN), and Transport Network (TN).
