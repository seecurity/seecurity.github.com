XDR: External Data Representation
standard
1987", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="XDR is a standard for the description and encoding of data.  It is useful for transferring data between different computer architectures.  XDR fits into ISO presentation layer, and is roughly analogous in purpose to X.409, ISO Abstract Syntax Notation.  The major difference between these two is that XDR uses implicit typing, while X.409 uses explicit typing.  This RFC is distributed for information only, it does not establish a Internet standard."];

In order to transmit Traffic Flow information from an Exporting Process to a Collecting Process, a common representation of flow data and a standard means of communicating them are required.

Relative Location Representation

The reference point may be expressed as a geodetic or civic location, and the relative offset may be one of several shapes. An alternative binary representation is described. Optionally, a reference to a secondary document (such as a map image) can be included, along with the relationship of the map coordinate system to the reference/offset coordinate system, to allow display of the map with the reference point and the relative offset."];
