BGP Route Reflection: An Alternative to
Full Mesh Internal BGP (IBGP)
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4456.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system routing protocol designed for TCP/IP internets. Typically, all BGP speakers within a single AS must be fully meshed so that any external routing information must be re-distributed to all other routers within that Autonomous System (AS). This represents a serious scaling problem that has been well documented with several alternatives proposed. This document describes the use and design of a method known as route reflection to alleviate the need for full mesh Internal BGP (IBGP). This document obsoletes RFC 2796 and RFC 1966.
