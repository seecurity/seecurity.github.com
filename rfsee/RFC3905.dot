The policies are also intended to benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while respecting the legitimate rights of IPR holders.  This memo details the IETF policies concerning IPR related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It also describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.  This memo updates RFC 2026 and, with RFC 3667, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026.  This memo also updates paragraph 4 of Section 3.2 of RFC 2028, for all purposes, including reference [2] in RFC 2418.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements."];
