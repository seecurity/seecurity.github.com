Impact of Shortest Path First (SPF)
Trigger and Delay Strategies on IGP
Micro-loops

Framework for Loop-Free Convergence
Using the Ordered Forwarding Information
Base (oFIB) Approach
2013", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6976.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes an illustrative framework of a mechanism for use in conjunction with link-state routing protocols that prevents the transient loops that would otherwise occur during topology changes. It does this by correctly sequencing the forwarding information base (FIB) updates on the routers. This mechanism can be used in the case of non-urgent (management action) link or node shutdowns and restarts or link metric changes. It can also be used in conjunction with a fast reroute mechanism that converts a sudden link or node failure into a non-urgent topology change. This is possible where a complete repair path is provided for all affected destinations. After a non-urgent topology change, each router computes a rank that defines the time at which it can safely update its FIB. A method for accelerating this loop-free convergence process by the use of completion messages is also described. The technology described in this document has been subject to extensive simulation using pathological convergence behavior and real network topologies and costs. However, the mechanisms described in this document are purely illustrative of the general approach and do not constitute a protocol specification. This document represents a snapshot of the work of the Routing Area Working Group at the time of publication and is published as a document of record. Further work is needed before implementation or deployment."];

Micro-loop Prevention by Introducing a
Local Convergence Delay
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8333.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a mechanism for link-state routing protocols that prevents local transient forwarding loops in case of link failure. This mechanism proposes a two-step convergence by introducing a delay between the convergence of the node adjacent to the topology change and the network-wide convergence. Because this mechanism delays the IGP convergence, it may only be used for planned maintenance or when Fast Reroute (FRR) protects the traffic during the time between the link failure and the IGP convergence. The mechanism is limited to the link-down event in order to keep the mechanism simple. Simulations using real network topologies have been performed and show that local loops are a significant portion (>50%) of the total forwarding loops."];
