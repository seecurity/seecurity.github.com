Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID)

Service providers and Computer Security Incident Response Teams need to be equipped and ready to assist in communicating and tracing security incidents with tools and procedures in place before the occurrence of an attack.  Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) outlines a proactive inter-network communication method to facilitate sharing incident-handling data while integrating existing detection, tracing, source identification, and mitigation mechanisms for a complete incident-handling solution.  Combining these capabilities in a communication system provides a way to achieve higher security levels on networks.  Policy guidelines for handling incidents are recommended and can be agreed upon by a consortium using the security recommendations and considerations.  This document obsoletes RFC 6045.

This document provides guidelines for IODEF implementers.  It addresses how common security indicators can be represented in IODEF and use-cases of how IODEF is being used.
