Digital Private Network Signaling System

2 (DASS 2) Extensions to the IUA
Protocol

DPNSS 1, specified in ND1301:2001/03 (formerly BTNR 188), is used to interconnect Private Branch Exchanges (PBX) in a private network.  DASS 2, specified in BTNR 190, is used to connect PBXs to the PSTN.  This document aims to become an Appendix to IUA and to be the base for a DPNSS 1/DASS 2 User Adaptation (DUA) implementation.
