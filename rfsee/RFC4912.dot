Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X)
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) is a semantically equivalent Extensible Markup Language (XML) representation for Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) specifications.  ASN.X completely avoids the numerous ambiguities inherent in the ASN.1 language; therefore, specifications written in ASN.X are much easier to parse and manage than original ASN.1 specifications.  ASN.X, together with the Robust XML Encoding Rules (RXER), constitutes a schema language for XML documents that offers, through other ASN.1 encoding rules, alternative compact binary encodings for XML instance documents.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];
