A redirect reference makes it possible to access the target resourced indirectly through any URI mapped to the redirect reference resource.  This specification does not address remapping of trees of resources or regular expression based redirections.  There are no integrity guarantees associated with redirect reference resources.  Other mechanisms can also be used to achieve the same functionality as this specification.
