A Usage for Shared Resources in RELOAD
(ShaRe)
2017", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines a REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Usage for managing shared write access to RELOAD Resources.  Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe) form a basic primitive for enabling various coordination and notification schemes among distributed peers.  Access in ShaRe is controlled by a hierarchical trust delegation scheme maintained within an access list.  A new USER-CHAIN-ACL access policy allows authorized peers to write a Shared Resource without owning its corresponding certificate.  This specification also adds mechanisms to store Resources with a variable name that is useful whenever peer-independent rendezvous processes are required."];

REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD)
Base Protocol
2014", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6940.html", target="_top", tooltip="This specification defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet.  A P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage and messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form the overlay network.  RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other applications with similar requirements by defining new usages that specify the Kinds of data that need to be stored for a particular application.  RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate enrollment service that provides unique identities.  NAT traversal is a fundamental service of the protocol.  RELOAD also allows access from client nodes that do not need to route traffic or store data for others."];

A SIP Usage for REsource LOcation And
Discovery (RELOAD)
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7904.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a SIP Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD).  The SIP Usage provides the functionality of a SIP proxy or registrar in a fully distributed system and includes a lookup service for Address of Records (AORs) stored in the overlay.  It also defines Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) that allow the registrations to map an AOR to a specific node reachable through the overlay.  After such initial contact of a Peer, the RELOAD AppAttach method is used to establish a direct connection between nodes through which SIP messages are exchanged."];
