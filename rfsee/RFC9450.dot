Deterministic Networking Architecture
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8655.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency within a network domain.  Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the network topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in spite of the loss of a path.  DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time- Sensitive Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1."];

Deterministic Networking Use Cases

Deterministic in this context means that such flows provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded latency, and other properties germane to the transport of time-sensitive data.  These use cases differ notably in their network topologies and specific desired behavior, providing as a group broad industry context for Deterministic Networking (DetNet).  For each use case, this document will identify the use case, identify representative solutions used today, and describe potential improvements that DetNet can enable."];

LDACS is a scheduled and reliable multi-application cellular broadband system with support for IPv6.  It is part of a larger shift of flight guidance communication moving to IP-based communication.  High reliability and availability of IP connectivity over LDACS, as well as security, are therefore essential.  The intent of this document is to introduce LDACS to the IETF community, raise awareness on related activities inside and outside of the IETF, and to seek expertise in shaping the shift of aeronautics to IP."];

Deterministic Networking (DetNet)
Security Considerations

As a result, securing a DetNet requires that in addition to the best practice security measures taken for any mission-critical network, additional security measures may be needed to secure the intended operation of these novel service properties. This document addresses DetNet-specific security considerations from the perspectives of both the DetNet system-level designer and component designer. System considerations include a taxonomy of relevant threats and attacks, and associations of threats versus use cases and service properties. Component-level considerations include ingress filtering and packet arrival-time violation detection. This document also addresses security considerations specific to the IP and MPLS data plane technologies, thereby complementing the Security Considerations sections of those documents."];

This document also discusses the expected behavior of XR applications, which can be used to manage traffic, and the service requirements for XR applications to be able to run on the network.
