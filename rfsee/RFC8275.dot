Allowing Inheritable NFSv4 Access
Control Entries to Override the Umask
2017", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In many environments, inheritable NFSv4 Access Control Entries (ACEs) can be rendered ineffective by the application of the per-process file mode creation mask (umask).  This can be addressed by transmitting the umask and create mode as separate pieces of data, allowing the server to make more intelligent decisions about the permissions to set on new files.  This document proposes a protocol extension to accomplish that.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Network File System (NFS) Version 4
Protocol
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7530.html", target="_top", tooltip="The Network File System (NFS) version 4 protocol is a distributed file system protocol that builds on the heritage of NFS protocol version 2 (RFC 1094) and version 3 (RFC 1813). Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4 protocol supports traditional file access while integrating support for file locking and the MOUNT protocol. In addition, support for strong security (and its negotiation), COMPOUND operations, client caching, and internationalization has been added. Of course, attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an Internet environment. This document, together with the companion External Data Representation (XDR) description document, RFC 7531, obsoletes RFC 3530 as the definition of the NFS version 4 protocol."];
