Architectural Principles for a Quantum
Internet
2023", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The vision of a quantum internet is to enhance existing Internet technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth.  To achieve this goal, a quantum network stack should be built from the ground up to account for the fundamentally new properties of quantum entanglement.  The first quantum entanglement networks have been realised, but there is no practical proposal for how to organise, utilise, and manage such networks.  In this document, we attempt to lay down the framework and introduce some basic architectural principles for a quantum internet.  This is intended for general guidance and general interest.  It is also intended to provide a foundation for discussion between physicists and network specialists.

Architectural Principles of the Internet

While this process of evolution is one of the main reasons for the technology's success, it nevertheless seems useful to record a snapshot of the current principles of the Internet architecture.  This is intended for general guidance and general interest, and is in no way intended to be a formal or invariant reference model.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.

This document provides an overview of some applications expected to be used on the Quantum Internet and categorizes them.  Some general requirements for the Quantum Internet are also discussed.
