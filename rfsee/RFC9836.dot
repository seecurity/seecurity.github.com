A YANG Data Model for Augmenting VPN

Attachment Circuits

model, to augment the LxVPN Service Model (LxSM) and LxVPN Network

Glue model enables a provider to associate Layer 2/3 VPN (LxVPN)
services with the underlying AC infrastructure, thereby facilitating
consistent provisioning and management of new or existing ACs in
conjunction with LxVPN services.  Specifically, by introducing an
integrated approach to AC and LxVPN management, this model supports
Attachment Circuit as a Service (ACaaS) and provides a standardized
mechanism for aligning AC/VPN requests with the network
configurations required to deliver them.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];
