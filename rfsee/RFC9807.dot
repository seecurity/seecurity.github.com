Randomness Requirements for Security
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4086.html", target="_top", tooltip="Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these systems is dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar quantities. The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can result in pseudo-security. A sophisticated attacker may find it easier to reproduce the environment that produced the secret quantities and to search the resulting small set of possibilities than to locate the quantities in the whole of the potential number space. Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult. This document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for generating such quantities. It recommends the use of truly random hardware techniques and shows that the existing hardware on many systems can be used for this purpose. It provides suggestions to ameliorate the problem when a hardware solution is not available, and it gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for some applications.

Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRFs)
Using Prime-Order Groups
2023", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9497.html", target="_top", tooltip="An Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol between a client and a server for computing the output of a Pseudorandom Function (PRF).  The server provides the PRF private key, and the client provides the PRF input.  At the end of the protocol, the client learns the PRF output without learning anything about the PRF private key, and the server learns neither the PRF input nor output.  An OPRF can also satisfy a notion of 'verifiability', called a VOPRF.  A VOPRF ensures clients can verify that the server used a specific private key during the execution of the protocol.  A VOPRF can also be partially oblivious, called a POPRF.  A POPRF allows clients and servers to provide public input to the PRF computation.
