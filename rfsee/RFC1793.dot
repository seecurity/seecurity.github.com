Detecting Inactive Neighbors over OSPF
Demand Circuits (DC)

OSPF behavior over demand circuits (DC) is optimized in RFC 1793 to minimize the amount of overhead traffic.  A part of the OSPF demand circuit extensions is the Hello suppression mechanism.  This technique allows a demand circuit to go down when no interesting traffic is going through the link.  However, it also introduces a problem, where it becomes impossible to detect an OSPF-inactive neighbor over such a link.  This memo introduces a new mechanism called neighbor probing to address the above problem. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Version 3 of the OSPF protocol is specific to the IPv6 address family. This memo obsoletes RFC 1850; however, it is designed to be backwards compatible.
