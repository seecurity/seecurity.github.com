Rebind Capability in DHCPv6 Reconfigure
Messages

It extends the Reconfigure message to allow a DHCPv6 server to cause a DHCPv6 client to send a Rebind message.  The document also clarifies how a DHCPv6 client responds to a received Reconfigure message. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Cryptographically Generated Addresses

Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) are IPv6 addresses for which the interface identifier is generated by computing a cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key and auxiliary parameters.  The binding between the public key and the address can be verified by re-computing the hash value and by comparing the hash with the interface identifier.  Messages sent from an IPv6 address can be protected by attaching the public key and auxiliary parameters and by signing the message with the corresponding private key.  The protection works without a certification authority or any security infrastructure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
