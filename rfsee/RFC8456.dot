Benchmarking Methodology for Software-
Defined Networking (SDN) Controller
Performance
2018", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document defines methodologies for benchmarking the control-plane performance of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Controllers.  The SDN Controller is a core component in the SDN architecture that controls the behavior of the network.  SDN Controllers have been implemented with many varying designs in order to achieve their intended network functionality.  Hence, the authors of this document have taken the approach of considering an SDN Controller to be a black box, defining the methodology in a manner that is agnostic to protocols and network services supported by controllers.  This document provides a method for measuring the performance of all controller implementations."];

Evaluation of a Sample of RFCs Produced
in 2018
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8963.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents the author's effort to understand the delays involved in publishing an idea in the IETF or through the Independent Stream, from the first individual draft to the publication of the RFC. We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFCs approved in 2018, looking for history and delays. We also use two randomly chosen sets of RFCs published in 2008 and 1998 for comparing delays seen in 2018 to those observed 10 or 20 years ago. The average RFC in the 2018 sample was produced in 3 years and 4 months, of which 2 years and 10 months were spent in the working group, 3 to 4 months for IETF consensus and IESG review, and 3 to 4 months in RFC production. The main variation in RFC production delays comes from the AUTH48 phase. We also measure the number of citations of the chosen RFC using Semantic Scholar, and compare citation counts with what we know about deployment. We show that citation counts indicate academic interest, but correlate only loosely with deployment or usage of the specifications. Counting web references could complement that."];
