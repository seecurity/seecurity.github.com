Additional WebRTC Audio Codecs for
Interoperability

However, to maximize the possibility of establishing the session without the need for audio transcoding, it is also recommended to include in the offer other suitable audio codecs that are available to the browser. This document provides some guidelines on the suitable codecs to be considered for WebRTC endpoints to address the use cases most relevant to interoperability.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Definition of the Opus Audio Codec
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6716.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the Opus interactive speech and audio codec.  Opus is designed to handle a wide range of interactive audio applications, including Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game chat, and even live, distributed music performances.  It scales from low bitrate narrowband speech at 6 kbit/s to very high quality stereo music at 510 kbit/s.  Opus uses both Linear Prediction (LP) and the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) to achieve good compression of both speech and music. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

RTP Payload Format and File Storage
Format for the Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR)

The payload format is designed to be able to interoperate with existing AMR and AMR-WB transport formats on non-IP networks.  In addition, a file format is specified for transport of AMR and AMR-WB speech data in storage mode applications such as email.  Two separate media type registrations are included, one for AMR and one for AMR-WB, specifying use of both the RTP payload format and the storage format.  This document obsoletes RFC 3267.

RTP Profile for Audio and Video
Conferences with Minimal Control
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3551.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a profile called RTP/AVP for the use of the real-time transport protocol (RTP), version 2, and the associated control protocol, RTCP, within audio and video multiparticipant conferences with minimal control.  It provides interpretations of generic fields within the RTP specification suitable for audio and video conferences.  In particular, this document defines a set of default mappings from payload type numbers to encodings.  This document also describes how audio and video data may be carried within RTP.  It defines a set of standard encodings and their names when used within RTP.  The descriptions provide pointers to reference implementations and the detailed standards.  This document is meant as an aid for implementors of audio, video and other real-time multimedia applications.  This memorandum obsoletes RFC 1890.  It is mostly backwards-compatible except for functions removed because two interoperable implementations were not found.  The additions to RFC 1890 codify existing practice in the use of payload formats under this profile and include new payload formats defined since RFC 1890 was published. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
