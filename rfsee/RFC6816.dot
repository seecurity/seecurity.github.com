Simple Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC)
Staircase Forward Error Correction (FEC)
Scheme for FECFRAME
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a fully specified simple Forward Error Correction (FEC) scheme for Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) Staircase codes that can be used to protect media streams along the lines defined by FECFRAME.  These codes have many interesting properties: they are systematic codes, they perform close to ideal codes in many use-cases, and they also feature very high encoding and decoding throughputs.  LDPC-Staircase codes are therefore a good solution to protect a single high bitrate source flow or to protect globally several mid-rate flows within a single FECFRAME instance.  They are also a good solution whenever the processing load of a software encoder or decoder must be kept to a minimum.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

The Use of Forward Error Correction
(FEC) in Reliable Multicast
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3453.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo describes the use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for one-to-many reliable data transport using IP multicast.  One of the key properties of FEC codes in this context is the ability to use the same packets containing FEC data to simultaneously repair different packet loss patterns at multiple receivers.  Different classes of FEC codes and some of their basic properties are described and terminology relevant to implementing FEC in a reliable multicast protocol is introduced.  Examples are provided of possible abstract formats for packets carrying FEC.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework

The framework supports applying FEC to arbitrary packet flows over unreliable transport and is primarily intended for real-time, or streaming, media.  This framework can be used to define Content Delivery Protocols that provide FEC for streaming media delivery or other packet flows.  Content Delivery Protocols defined using this framework can support any FEC scheme (and associated FEC codes) that is compliant with various requirements defined in this document.  Thus, Content Delivery Protocols can be defined that are not specific to a particular FEC scheme, and FEC schemes can be defined that are not specific to a particular Content Delivery Protocol.

This document defines a framework for the definition of the information that needs to be communicated in order to use an FEC code for bulk data transfer, in addition to the encoded data itself, and for definition of formats and codes for communication of that information.  Both information communicated with the encoded data itself and information that needs to be communicated 'out-of-band' are considered.  The procedures for specifying new FEC codes, defining the information communication requirements associated with those codes and registering them with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) are also described.  The requirements on Content Delivery Protocols that wish to use FEC codes defined within this framework are also defined.

NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM)
Transport Protocol
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5740.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the messages and procedures of the Negative- ACKnowledgment (NACK) Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol.  This protocol can provide end-to-end reliable transport of bulk data objects or streams over generic IP multicast routing and forwarding services.  NORM uses a selective, negative acknowledgment mechanism for transport reliability and offers additional protocol mechanisms to allow for operation with minimal a priori coordination among senders and receivers.  A congestion control scheme is specified to allow the NORM protocol to fairly share available network bandwidth with other transport protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  It is capable of operating with both reciprocal multicast routing among senders and receivers and with asymmetric connectivity (possibly a unicast return path) between the senders and receivers.  The protocol offers a number of features to allow different types of applications or possibly other higher-level transport protocols to utilize its service in different ways.  The protocol leverages the use of FEC-based (forward error correction) repair and other IETF Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks in its design.  This document obsoletes RFC 3940.

The decoder is able to recover the source block from any set of encoding symbols only slightly more in number than the number of source symbols. The Raptor code described here is a systematic code, meaning that all the source symbols are among the encoding symbols that can be generated. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Finally, in the context of the Under-Specified Small Block Systematic FEC Scheme (FEC Encoding ID 129), this document assigns an FEC Instance ID to the special case of Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8). Reed-Solomon codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes, i.e., they enable a receiver to recover the k source symbols from any set of k received symbols.

This document updates RFC 6363 to support FEC codes based on a sliding encoding window, in addition to block FEC codes, in a backward-compatible way.
