The protocol presented in this document meets the requirements for a media gateway control protocol as presented in RFC 2805.  This document replaces RFC 3015.  It is the result of continued cooperation between the IETF Megaco Working Group and ITU-T Study Group 16.  It incorporates the original text of RFC 3015, modified by corrections and clarifications discussed on the Megaco E-mail list and incorporated into the Study Group 16 Implementor's Guide for Recommendation H.248.  The present version of this document underwent ITU-T Last Call as Recommendation H.248 Amendment 1.  Because of ITU-T renumbering, it was published by the ITU-T as Recommendation H.248.1 (03/2002), Gateway Control Protocol Version 1.  Users of this specification are advised to consult the H.248 Sub-series Implementors' Guide at http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/com16/implgd for additional corrections and clarifications.
