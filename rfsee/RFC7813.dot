IS-IS Extensions Supporting IEEE 802.1aq
Shortest Path Bridging
2012", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6329.html", target="_top", tooltip="802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) has been standardized by the IEEE as the next step in the evolution of the various spanning tree and registration protocols.  802.1aq allows for true shortest path forwarding in a mesh Ethernet network context utilizing multiple equal cost paths.  This permits it to support much larger Layer 2 topologies, with faster convergence, and vastly improved use of the mesh topology.  Combined with this is single point provisioning for logical connectivity membership, which includes point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-multipoint variations.  This memo documents the IS-IS changes required to support this IEEE protocol and provides some context and examples. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Three-Way Handshake for IS-IS Point-to-
Point Adjacencies
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5303.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IS-IS routing protocol (Intermediate System to Intermediate System, ISO 10589) requires reliable protocols at the link layer for point-to-point links. As a result, it does not use a three-way handshake when establishing adjacencies on point-to-point media. This paper defines a backward-compatible extension to the protocol that provides for a three-way handshake. It is fully interoperable with systems that do not support the extension. Additionally, the extension allows the robust operation of more than 256 point-to-point links on a single router. This extension has been implemented by multiple router vendors; this paper is provided to the Internet community in order to allow interoperable implementations to be built by other vendors.
