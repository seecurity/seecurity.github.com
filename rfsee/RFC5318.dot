This P-Header is used in the Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA) Push to talk over Cellular (PoC) system.  It enables URI-list servers to refuse the handling of incoming URI lists that have embedded URI lists.  This P-Header also makes it possible for the URI-list server to inform the client about the embedded URI list that caused the rejection and the individual URIs that form such a URI list.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Unfortunately, it expressed the constraints with prose copied into each header field definition, and at least one header field was missed. Further, the constraint has not been copied into documents defining extension headers whose grammar contains the alternative. This document updates RFC 3261 to state the constraint generically and clarifies that the constraint applies to all SIP header fields where there is a choice between using name-addr or addr-spec.
