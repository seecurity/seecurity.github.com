The subject name, carried in the subject field, is only unique for each subject entity certified by the one CA as defined by the issuer name field. However, the new name form can carry a name that is unique for each subject entity certified by a CA. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A new approach different from Stringprep and Nameprep is used for a revision of IDNA2003 (called IDNA2008).
