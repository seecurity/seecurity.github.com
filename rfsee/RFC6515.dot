IPv4 and IPv6 Infrastructure Addresses
in BGP Updates for Multicast VPN
2012", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) service, Provider Edge routers originate BGP Update messages that carry Multicast-VPN (MCAST-VPN) BGP routes; they also originate unicast VPN routes that carry MVPN-specific attributes.  These routes encode addresses from the customer's address space, as well as addresses from the provider's address space.  These two address spaces are independent, and the address family (IPv4 or IPv6) of the two spaces may or may not be the same.  These routes always contain an address family field that specifies whether the customer addresses are IPv4 addresses or whether they are IPv6 addresses.  However, there is no field that explicitly specifies the address family of the provider addresses.  To ensure interoperability, this document specifies that provider IPv4 addresses are always encoded in these update messages as 4-octet addresses, and that the distinction between IPv4 and IPv6 is signaled solely by the length of the address field.  Specific cases are explained in detail.  This document updates RFC 6514. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green];

BGP-MPLS IP Virtual Private Network

This method reuses, and extends where necessary, the BGP/MPLS IP VPN method for support of IPv6. In BGP/MPLS IP VPN, Multiprotocol BGP is used for distributing IPv4 VPN routes over the service provider backbone, and MPLS is used to forward IPv4 VPN packets over the backbone. This document defines an IPv6 VPN address family and describes the corresponding IPv6 VPN route distribution in Multiprotocol BGP. This document defines support of the IPv6 VPN service over both an IPv4 and an IPv6 backbone, and for using various tunneling techniques over the core, including MPLS, IP-in-IP, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) and IPsec protected tunnels. The inter-working between an IPv4 site and an IPv6 site is outside the scope of this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Connecting IPv6 Islands over IPv4 MPLS
Using IPv6 Provider Edge Routers (6PE)
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4798.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document explains how to interconnect IPv6 islands over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)-enabled IPv4 cloud.  This approach relies on IPv6 Provider Edge routers (6PE), which are Dual Stack in order to connect to IPv6 islands and to the MPLS core, which is only required to run IPv4 MPLS.  The 6PE routers exchange the IPv6 reachability information transparently over the core using the Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) over IPv4.  In doing so, the BGP Next Hop field is used to convey the IPv4 address of the 6PE router so that dynamically established IPv4-signaled MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be used without explicit tunnel configuration.

With a small number of relatively minor modifications, the same BGP procedures can also be used to distribute multicast routing information that is not specific to any VPN.

Ingress Replication Tunnels in Multicast

These procedures create point-to-multipoint (P2MP) or multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) trees across the Service Provider's backbone.  One type of P2MP tree that may be used is known as an Ingress Replication (IR) tunnel.  In an IR tunnel, a parent node need not be directly connected to its child nodes.  When a parent node has to send a multicast data packet to its n child nodes, it does not use Layer 2 multicast, IP multicast, or MPLS multicast to do so.  Rather, it makes n individual copies, and then unicasts each copy, through an IP or MPLS unicast tunnel, to exactly one child node.  While the prior MVPN specifications allow the use of IR tunnels, those specifications are not always very clear or explicit about how the MVPN protocol elements and procedures are applied to IR tunnels.  This document updates RFCs 6513 and 6514 by adding additional details that are specific to the use of IR tunnels."];
