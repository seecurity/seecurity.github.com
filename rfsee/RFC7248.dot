These extensions provide additional information about the presentity and its contacts. The information is designed so that much of it can be derived automatically, e.g., from calendar files or user activity. This extension includes information about what the person is doing, a grouping identifier for a tuple, when a service or device was last used, the type of place a person is in, what media communications might remain private, the relationship of a service tuple to another presentity, the person's mood, the time zone it is located in, the type of service it offers, an icon reflecting the presentity's status, and the overall role of the presentity.
