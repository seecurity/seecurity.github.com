Network performance measurement with

First, the memo motivates periodic sampling and addresses the question of its value as an alternative to the Poisson sampling described in RFC 2330.  The benefits include applicability to active and passive measurements, simulation of constant bit rate (CBR) traffic (typical of multimedia communication, or nearly CBR, as found with voice activity detection), and several instances in which analysis can be simplified.  The sampling method avoids predictability by mandating random start times and finite length tests.  Following descriptions of the sampling method and sample metric parameters, measurement methods and errors are discussed.  Finally, we give additional information on periodic measurements, including security considerations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

The memo first defines a reordered singleton, and then uses it as the basis for sample metrics to quantify the extent of reordering in several useful dimensions for network characterization or receiver design.  Additional metrics quantify the frequency of reordering and the distance between separate occurrences.  We then define a metric oriented toward assessment of reordering effects on TCP.  Several examples of evaluation using the various sample metrics are included.  An appendix gives extended definitions for evaluating order with packet fragmentation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
