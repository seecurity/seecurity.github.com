Extensions to OSPF for Advertising
Prefix Administrative Tags
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9825.html", target="_top", tooltip="It is useful for routers in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 routing domains to be able to associate tags with prefixes.  Previously, OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 were relegated to a single tag and only for Autonomous System (AS) External and Not-So-Stubby-Area (NSSA) prefixes.  With the flexible encodings provided by OSPFv2 Prefix/Link Attribute Advertisement and OSPFv3 Extended Link State Advertisements (LSAs), multiple administrative tags may be advertised for all types of prefixes.  These administrative tags can be used for many applications including route redistribution policy, selective prefix prioritization, selective IP Fast Reroute (IPFRR) prefix protection, and many others."];

A Common YANG Data Model for Attachment

model, which is designed to be reusable by other models.  This design
is meant to ensure consistent AC structures among models that
manipulate ACs.  For example, this common model can be reused by
service models to expose ACs as a service, service models that
require binding a service to a set of ACs, network and device models
to provision ACs, etc."];

YANG Data Models for Bearers and

provisioned over the links that connect customer termination points
and a provider network. The required setup to allow successful data
exchange over these links is referred to as an attachment circuit
(AC), while the underlying link is referred to as a bearer. This document specifies a YANG service data model for ACs. This model
can be used for the provisioning of ACs before or during service
provisioning (e.g., RFC 9543 Network Slice Service). The document also specifies a YANG service data model for managing
bearers over which ACs are established."];

model, to augment the LxVPN Service Model (LxSM) and LxVPN Network
Model (LxNM) with references to attachment circuits (ACs).  The AC
Glue model enables a provider to associate Layer 2/3 VPN (LxVPN)
services with the underlying AC infrastructure, thereby facilitating
consistent provisioning and management of new or existing ACs in
conjunction with LxVPN services.  Specifically, by introducing an
integrated approach to AC and LxVPN management, this model supports
Attachment Circuit as a Service (ACaaS) and provides a standardized
mechanism for aligning AC/VPN requests with the network
configurations required to deliver them."];
