IAB Concerns Regarding Congestion
Control for Voice Traffic in the
Internet
2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3714.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document discusses IAB concerns about effective end-to-end congestion control for best-effort voice traffic in the Internet.  These concerns have to do with fairness, user quality, and with the dangers of congestion collapse.  The concerns are particularly relevant in light of the absence of a widespread Quality of Service (QoS) deployment in the Internet, and the likelihood that this situation will not change much in the near term.  This document is not making any recommendations about deployment paths for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in terms of QoS support, and is not claiming that best-effort service can be relied upon to give acceptable performance for VoIP.  We are merely observing that voice traffic is occasionally deployed as best-effort traffic over some links in the Internet, that we expect this occasional deployment to continue, and that we have concerns about the lack of effective end-to-end congestion control for this best-effort voice traffic.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Comments on the Usefulness of Simple
Best-Effort Traffic
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5290.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents some observations on simple best-effort traffic, defined loosely for the purposes of this document as Internet traffic that is not covered by Quality of Service (QOS) mechanisms, congestion-based pricing, cost-based fairness, admissions control, or the like.  One observation is that simple best-effort traffic serves a useful role in the Internet, and is worth keeping.  While differential treatment of traffic can clearly be useful, we believe such mechanisms are useful as *adjuncts* to simple best- effort traffic, not as *replacements* of simple best-effort traffic.  A second observation is that for simple best-effort traffic, some form of rough flow-rate fairness is a useful goal for resource allocation, where flow-rate fairness is defined by the goal of equal flow rates for different flows over the same path.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
