LDP Specification

A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through them.  This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has made.  This document defines a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths.

MPLS Multicast Encapsulations

The second codepoint (formerly the multicast codepoint) is now to be used only on multiaccess media, and it is to mean the top label of the following label stack is an upstream-assigned label. RFC 3032 does not specify the destination address to be placed in the MAC DA (Medium Access Layer Destination Address) field of an ethernet frame that carries an MPLS multicast packet.

Operating on the basis of multihomed customer edge (CE), redundant PWs, upstream label assignment, and context-specific label switching, the mechanism enables local repair to be performed by the router upstream adjacent to a failure.  The router can restore a PW in the order of tens of milliseconds, by rerouting traffic around the failure to a protector through a pre-established bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the mechanism can be used to reduce traffic loss before global repair reacts to the failure and the network converges on the topology changes due to the failure."];
