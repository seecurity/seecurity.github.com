The second codepoint (formerly the multicast codepoint) is now to be used only on multiaccess media, and it is to mean the top label of the following label stack is an upstream-assigned label. RFC 3032 does not specify the destination address to be placed in the MAC DA (Medium Access Layer Destination Address) field of an ethernet frame that carries an MPLS multicast packet.
