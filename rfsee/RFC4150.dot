The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the Framework over time.  The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.  The document also recommends that RFCs 1157, 1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic status.  This document obsoletes RFC 2570.

Network performance measurement with

First, the memo motivates periodic sampling and addresses the question of its value as an alternative to the Poisson sampling described in RFC 2330.  The benefits include applicability to active and passive measurements, simulation of constant bit rate (CBR) traffic (typical of multimedia communication, or nearly CBR, as found with voice activity detection), and several instances in which analysis can be simplified.  The sampling method avoids predictability by mandating random start times and finite length tests.  Following descriptions of the sampling method and sample metric parameters, measurement methods and errors are discussed.  Finally, we give additional information on periodic measurements, including security considerations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

It has been designed to provide short time-till-playback for the end user and to prevent disruption of the streams by malicious peers.  PPSPP has also been designed to be flexible and extensible.  It can use different mechanisms to optimize peer uploading, prevent freeriding, and work with different peer discovery schemes (centralized trackers or Distributed Hash Tables).  It supports multiple methods for content integrity protection and chunk addressing.  Designed as a generic protocol that can run on top of various transport protocols, it currently runs on top of UDP using Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) for congestion control."];
