Registration Transition

That requirement discouraged some registrations and increased the risk for problems that could occur as a result.

This document clarifies the status of relevant older RFCs and confirms and documents advice to IANA about selected existing registrations.  This document also obsoletes RFCs 3044 and 3187 and moves them to Historic status.
