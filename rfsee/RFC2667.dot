defining, registering, or evaluating definitions of new interface

the IANA interface type registry predated the use of IANA
Considerations sections and YANG modules, so some confusion arose
over time.  Tunnel types were added later, with the same requirements
and allocation policy as interface types.  This document updates RFC
2863 and provides updated guidance for these registries."];
