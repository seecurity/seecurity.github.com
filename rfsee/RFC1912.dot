They also enable aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible with CNAME.  The HTTPS RR is a variation of SVCB for use with HTTP (see RFC 9110, HTTP Semantics).  By providing more information to the client before it attempts to establish a connection, these records offer potential benefits to both performance and privacy."];
