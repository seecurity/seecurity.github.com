The Use of Forward Error Correction
(FEC) in Reliable Multicast
2002", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3453.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo describes the use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for one-to-many reliable data transport using IP multicast.  One of the key properties of FEC codes in this context is the ability to use the same packets containing FEC data to simultaneously repair different packet loss patterns at multiple receivers.  Different classes of FEC codes and some of their basic properties are described and terminology relevant to implementing FEC in a reliable multicast protocol is introduced.  Examples are provided of possible abstract formats for packets carrying FEC.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

This document defines a framework for the definition of the information that needs to be communicated in order to use an FEC code for bulk data transfer, in addition to the encoded data itself, and for definition of formats and codes for communication of that information.  Both information communicated with the encoded data itself and information that needs to be communicated 'out-of-band' are considered.  The procedures for specifying new FEC codes, defining the information communication requirements associated with those codes and registering them with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) are also described.  The requirements on Content Delivery Protocols that wish to use FEC codes defined within this framework are also defined.  The companion document titled The Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) in Reliable Multicast describes some applications of FEC codes for delivering content.  This document obsoletes RFC 3452.

Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant
Authentication (TESLA): Multicast Source
Authentication Transform Introduction
2005", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4082.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document introduces Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication (TESLA). TESLA allows all receivers to check the integrity and authenticate the source of each packet in multicast or broadcast data streams. TESLA requires no trust between receivers, uses low-cost operations per packet at both sender and receiver, can tolerate any level of loss without retransmissions, and requires no per-receiver state at the sender. TESLA can protect receivers against denial of service attacks in certain circumstances. Each receiver must be loosely time-synchronized with the source in order to verify messages, but otherwise receivers do not have to send any messages. TESLA alone cannot support non-repudiation of the data source to third parties. This informational document is intended to assist in writing standardizable and secure specifications for protocols based on TESLA in different contexts.

These codes have many interesting properties: they are systematic codes, they perform close to ideal codes in many use-cases, and they also feature very high encoding and decoding throughputs.  LDPC-Staircase codes are therefore a good solution to protect a single high bitrate source flow or to protect globally several mid-rate flows within a single FECFRAME instance.  They are also a good solution whenever the processing load of a software encoder or decoder must be kept to a minimum."];

The Reed-Solomon codes considered have attractive properties, since they offer optimal protection against packet erasures and the source symbols are part of the encoding symbols, which can greatly simplify decoding.  However, the price to pay is a limit on the maximum source block size, on the maximum number of encoding symbols, and a computational complexity higher than that of the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, for instance."];

They can protect arbitrary media streams along the lines defined by FECFRAME extended to Sliding Window FEC Codes.  These Sliding Window FEC Codes rely on an encoding window that slides over the source symbols, generating new repair symbols whenever needed.  Compared to block FEC codes, these Sliding Window FEC Codes offer key advantages with real-time flows in terms of reduced FEC-related latency while often providing improved packet erasure recovery capabilities."];
