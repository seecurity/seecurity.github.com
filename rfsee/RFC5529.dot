IP Security (IPsec) and Internet Key
Exchange (IKE) Document Roadmap
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6071.html", target="_top", tooltip="Over the past few years, the number of RFCs that define and use IPsec and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) has greatly proliferated. This is complicated by the fact that these RFCs originate from numerous IETF working groups: the original IPsec WG, its various spin-offs, and other WGs that use IPsec and/or IKE to protect their protocols' traffic. This document is a snapshot of IPsec- and IKE-related RFCs. It includes a brief description of each RFC, along with background information explaining the motivation and context of IPsec's outgrowths and extensions. It obsoletes RFC 2411, the previous IP Security Document Roadmap. The obsoleted IPsec roadmap (RFC 2411) briefly described the interrelationship of the various classes of base IPsec documents. The major focus of RFC 2411 was to specify the recommended contents of documents specifying additional encryption and authentication algorithms. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];

Algorithm Implementation Requirements
and Usage Guidance for the Internet Key
Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)
2017", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8247.html", target="_top", tooltip="The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms in order to provide security services.  The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol is used to negotiate the IPsec Security Association (IPsec SA) parameters, such as which algorithms should be used.  To ensure interoperability between different implementations, it is necessary to specify a set of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations support.  This document updates RFC 7296 and obsoletes RFC 4307 in defining the current algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance for IKEv2, and does minor cleaning up of the IKEv2 IANA registry.  This document does not update the algorithms used for packet encryption using IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)."];
