Sliding Window Random Linear Code (RLC)
Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) Schemes

They can protect arbitrary media streams along the lines defined by FECFRAME extended to Sliding Window FEC Codes.  These Sliding Window FEC Codes rely on an encoding window that slides over the source symbols, generating new repair symbols whenever needed.

Content Delivery Protocols defined using this framework can support any FEC scheme (and associated FEC codes) that is compliant with various requirements defined in this document.  Thus, Content Delivery Protocols can be defined that are not specific to a particular FEC scheme, and FEC schemes can be defined that are not specific to a particular Content Delivery Protocol.

Simple Reed-Solomon Forward Error
Correction (FEC) Scheme for FECFRAME

The Reed-Solomon codes considered have attractive properties, since they offer optimal protection against packet erasures and the source symbols are part of the encoding symbols, which can greatly simplify decoding.  However, the price to pay is a limit on the maximum source block size, on the maximum number of encoding symbols, and a computational complexity higher than that of the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, for instance."];

These codes have many interesting properties: they are systematic codes, they perform close to ideal codes in many use-cases, and they also feature very high encoding and decoding throughputs.  LDPC-Staircase codes are therefore a good solution to protect a single high bitrate source flow or to protect globally several mid-rate flows within a single FECFRAME instance.  They are also a good solution whenever the processing load of a software encoder or decoder must be kept to a minimum."];

The Raptor and RaptorQ codes are systematic codes, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent in one or more repair flows in addition to the source symbols that are sent to the receiver(s) within a source flow.  The Raptor and RaptorQ codes offer close to optimal protection against arbitrary packet losses at a low computational complexity.  Six FEC Schemes are defined: two for the protection of arbitrary packet flows, two that are optimized for small source blocks, and two for the protection of a single flow that already contains a sequence number.  Repair data may be sent over arbitrary datagram transport (e.g., UDP) or using RTP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
