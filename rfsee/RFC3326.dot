The Reason Header Field for the Session

This contact is generally in the form of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), such as Contact: <sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com> and is generally dynamic and associated with the IP address or hostname of the SIP User Agent (UA).  The problem is that network topology may have one or more SIP proxies between the UA and the registrar, such that any request traveling from the user's home network to the registered UA must traverse these proxies.  The REGISTER method does not give us a mechanism to discover and record this sequence of proxies in the registrar for future use.  This document defines an extension header field, Path which provides such a mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

This response code enables calling parties to learn that an intermediary rejected their call attempt.  No one will deliver, and thus answer, the call.  As a 6xx code, the caller will be aware that future attempts to contact the same User Agent Server will likely fail.  The initial use case driving the need for the 608 response code is when the intermediary is an analytics engine.  In this case, the rejection is by a machine or other process.  This contrasts with the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response code in which a human at the target User Agent Server indicates the user did not want the call.  In some jurisdictions, this distinction is important.  This document also defines the use of the Call-Info header field in 608 responses to enable rejected callers to contact entities that blocked their calls in error.
