Analysis of Multihoming in Network
Mobility Support
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document is an analysis of multihoming in the context of network mobility (NEMO) in IPv6.  As there are many situations in which mobile networks may be multihomed, a taxonomy is proposed to classify the possible configurations.  The possible deployment scenarios of multihomed mobile networks are described together with the associated issues when network mobility is supported by RFC 3963 (NEMO Basic Support).  Recommendations are offered on how to address these issues.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Multiple Care-of Addresses Registration
2009", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5648.html", target="_top", tooltip="According to the current Mobile IPv6 specification, a mobile node may have several care-of addresses but only one, called the primary care-of address, can be registered with its home agent and the correspondent nodes.  However, for matters of cost, bandwidth, delay, etc, it is useful for the mobile node to get Internet access through multiple accesses simultaneously, in which case the mobile node would be configured with multiple active IPv6 care-of addresses.  This document proposes extensions to the Mobile IPv6 protocol to register and use multiple care-of addresses.  The extensions proposed in this document can be used by mobile routers using the NEMO (Network Mobility) Basic Support protocol as well. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
