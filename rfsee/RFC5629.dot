A Framework for Application Interaction
in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2009", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes a framework for the interaction between users and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based applications.  By interacting with applications, users can guide the way in which they operate.  The focus of this framework is stimulus signaling, which allows a user agent (UA) to interact with an application without knowledge of the semantics of that application.  Stimulus signaling can occur to a user interface running locally with the client, or to a remote user interface, through media streams.  Stimulus signaling encompasses a wide range of mechanisms, ranging from clicking on hyperlinks, to pressing buttons, to traditional Dual-Tone Multi- Frequency (DTMF) input.  In all cases, stimulus signaling is supported through the use of markup languages, which play a key role in this framework. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

A Call Control and Multi-Party Usage
Framework for the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5850.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a framework and the requirements for call control and multi-party usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  To enable discussion of multi-party features and applications, we define an abstract call model for describing the media relationships required by many of these.  The model and actions described here are specifically chosen to be independent of the SIP signaling and/or mixing approach chosen to actually set up the media relationships.  In addition to its dialog manipulation aspect, this framework includes requirements for communicating related information and events such as conference and session state and session history.  This framework also describes other goals that embody the spirit of SIP applications as used on the Internet such as the definition of primitives (not services), invoker and participant oriented primitives, signaling and mixing model independence, and others.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
