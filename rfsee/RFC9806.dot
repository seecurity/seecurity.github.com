Updates to SIP-Based Media Recording
(SIPREC) to Correct Metadata Media Type
2025", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="The SIP-based Media Recording (SIPREC) protocol is defined by both Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Metadata (RFC 7865) and Session Recording Protocol (RFC 7866).  Unfortunately, both RFCs contradict each other regarding how recording metadata is to be labeled.  In addition, neither RFC registered the new media type.  This document updates RFC 7866 to align with RFC 7865 when labeling recording metadata and also registers the media type.", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

The Session Recording Protocol specifies the use of SIP, SDP, and RTP to establish a Recording Session (RS) between the Session Recording Client (SRC), which is on the path of the CS, and a Session Recording Server (SRS) at the recording device.  This document considers only active recording, where the SRC purposefully streams media to an SRS and all participating user agents (UAs) are notified of the recording.  Passive recording, where a recording device detects media directly from the network (e.g., using port-mirroring techniques), is outside the scope of this document.  In addition, lawful intercept is outside the scope of this document."];

Recording Metadata

In some of these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory, compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  The recording of a session is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a recording device.
