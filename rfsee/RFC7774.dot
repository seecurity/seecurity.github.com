Configuration Option for DHCPv6

MPL has a set of parameters to control its behavior, and the parameter set is often configured as a network-wide parameter because the parameter set should be identical for each MPL Forwarder in an MPL Domain.  Using the MPL Parameter Configuration Option defined in this document, a network can easily be configured with a single set of MPL parameters."];

Multicast Protocol for Low-Power and
Lossy Networks (MPL)
2016", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7731.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies the Multicast Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (MPL), which provides IPv6 multicast forwarding in constrained networks. MPL avoids the need to construct or maintain any multicast forwarding topology, disseminating messages to all MPL Forwarders in an MPL Domain. MPL has two modes of operation. One mode uses the Trickle algorithm to manage control-plane and data-plane message transmissions and is applicable for deployments with few multicast sources. The other mode uses classic flooding. By providing both modes and parameterization of the Trickle algorithm, an MPL implementation can be used in a variety of multicast deployments and can trade between dissemination latency and transmission efficiency."];

The Trickle Algorithm

Dynamically adjusting transmission windows allows Trickle to spread new information on the scale of link-layer transmission times while sending only a few messages per hour when information does not change.  A simple suppression mechanism and transmission point selection allow Trickle's communication rate to scale logarithmically with density.
