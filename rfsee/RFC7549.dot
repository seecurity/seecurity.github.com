3GPP SIP URI Inter-Operator Traffic Leg
Parameter
2015", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="In 3GPP networks, the signaling path between a calling user and a called user can be partitioned into segments, referred to as traffic legs. Each traffic leg may span networks belonging to different operators and will have its own characteristics that can be different from other traffic legs in the same call. A traffic leg might be associated with multiple SIP dialogs, e.g., in case a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA) that modifies the SIP dialog identifier is located within the traffic leg. This document defines a new SIP URI parameter, 'iotl' (an abbreviation for Inter-Operator Traffic Leg). The parameter can be used in a SIP URI to indicate that the entity associated with the address, or an entity responsible for the host part of the address, represents the end of a specific traffic leg (or multiple traffic legs).", style=filled, fillcolor=green, fontsize=18, penwidth=3, fontweight=bold];

Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.
