The fundamental mechanisms of OSPF (flooding, Designated Router (DR) election, area support, Short Path First (SPF) calculations, etc.) remain unchanged.

These modifications will necessitate incrementing the protocol version from version 2 to version 3. OSPF for IPv6 is also referred to as OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3). Changes between OSPF for IPv4, OSPF Version 2, and OSPF for IPv6 as described herein include the following. Addressing semantics have been removed from OSPF packets and the basic Link State Advertisements (LSAs). New LSAs have been created to carry IPv6 addresses and prefixes. OSPF now runs on a per-link basis rather than on a per-IP-subnet basis. Flooding scope for LSAs has been generalized. Authentication has been removed from the OSPF protocol and instead relies on IPv6's Authentication Header and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). Even with larger IPv6 addresses, most packets in OSPF for IPv6 are almost as compact as those in OSPF for IPv4. Most fields and packet- size limitations present in OSPF for IPv4 have been relaxed. In addition, option handling has been made more flexible.

A Segment Routing over MPLS (SR-MPLS) network may consist of multiple IGP domains or multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes) under the control of the same organization.  It is useful to have the Label Switched Path (LSP) ping and traceroute procedures when an SR end-to-end path traverses multiple ASes or IGP domains.  This document outlines mechanisms to enable efficient LSP ping and traceroute procedures in inter-AS and inter-domain SR-MPLS networks.  This is achieved through a straightforward extension to the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocol, relying solely on data plane forwarding for handling echo replies on transit nodes."];

Compressed SRv6 Segment List Encoding
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9800.html", target="_top", tooltip="Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) is the instantiation of Segment Routing (SR) on the IPv6 data plane. This document specifies new flavors for the SRv6 endpoint behaviors defined in RFC 8986, which enable the compression of an SRv6 segment list. Such compression significantly reduces the size of the SRv6 encapsulation needed to steer packets over long segment lists. This document updates RFC 8754 by allowing a Segment List entry in the Segment Routing Header (SRH) to be either an IPv6 address, as specified in RFC 8754, or a REPLACE-CSID container in packed format, as specified in this document."];

BGP Classful Transport Planes
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9832.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a mechanism referred to as Intent-Driven Service Mapping. The mechanism uses BGP to express Intent-based association of overlay routes with underlay routes having specific Traffic Engineering (TE) characteristics satisfying a certain Service Level Agreement (SLA). This is achieved by defining new constructs to group underlay routes with sufficiently similar TE characteristics into identifiable classes (called Transport Classes or TCs), that overlay routes use as an ordered set to resolve reachability (Resolution Schemes) towards service endpoints. These constructs can be used, for example, to realize the IETF Network Slice defined in the TEAS Network Slices framework (RFC 9543). Additionally, this document specifies protocol procedures for BGP that enable dissemination of service mapping information in a network that may span multiple cooperating administrative domains. These domains may be administered either by the same provider or by closely coordinating providers. A new BGP address family that leverages the procedures described in RFC 4364 (BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)) and follows the NLRI encoding described in RFC 8277 (Using BGP to Bind MPLS Labels to Address Prefixes) is defined to enable each advertised underlay route to be identified by its class. This new address family is called BGP Classful Transport (or BGP CT)."];

Topology Independent Fast Reroute Using
Segment Routing
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9855.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents Topology Independent Loop-Free Alternate (TI-LFA) Fast Reroute (FRR), which is aimed at providing protection of node and Adjacency segments within the Segment Routing (SR) framework.  This FRR behavior builds on proven IP FRR concepts being LFAs, Remote LFAs (RLFAs), and Directed Loop-Free Alternates (DLFAs).  It extends these concepts to provide guaranteed coverage in any two-connected networks using a link-state IGP.  An important aspect of TI-LFA is the FRR path selection approach establishing protection over the expected post-convergence paths from the Point of Local Repair (PLR), reducing the operational need to control the tie-breaks among various FRR options."];

BGP Color-Aware Routing (CAR)
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9871.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a BGP-based routing solution to establish end-to-end intent-aware paths across a multi-domain transport network. The transport network can span multiple service provider and customer network domains. The BGP intent-aware paths can be used to steer traffic flows for service routes that need a specific intent. This solution is called BGP Color-Aware Routing (BGP CAR). This document describes the routing framework and BGP extensions to enable intent-aware routing using the BGP CAR solution. The solution defines two new BGP SAFIs (BGP CAR SAFI and BGP VPN CAR SAFI) for IPv4 and IPv6. It also defines an extensible Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) model for both SAFIs that allows multiple NLRI types to be defined for different use cases. Each type of NLRI contains key and TLV-based non-key fields for efficient encoding of different per-prefix information. This specification defines two NLRI types: Color-Aware Route NLRI and IP Prefix NLRI. It defines non-key TLV types for the MPLS label stack, SR-MPLS label index, and Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) Segment Identifiers (SIDs). This solution also defines a new Local Color Mapping (LCM) Extended Community."];
