Basic Socket Interface Extensions for

The extensions focus on the use of public-key-based identifiers discovered via DNS resolution, but also define interfaces for manual bindings between Host Identity Tags (HITs) and locators.  With the extensions, the application can also support more relaxed security models where communication can be non-HIP-based, according to local policies.  The extensions in this document are experimental and provide basic tools for further experimentation with policies.

Shim6: Level 3 Multihoming Shim Protocol

The hosts in a site that has multiple provider- allocated IPv6 address prefixes will use the Shim6 protocol specified in this document to set up state with peer hosts so that the state can later be used to failover to a different locator pair, should the original one stop working.

An IPv6 Prefix for Overlay Routable
Cryptographic Hash Identifiers (ORCHID)
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4843.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document introduces Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers (ORCHID) as a new, experimental class of IPv6-address- like identifiers. These identifiers are intended to be used as endpoint identifiers at applications and Application Programming Interfaces (API) and not as identifiers for network location at the IP layer, i.e., locators. They are designed to appear as application layer entities and at the existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not appear in actual IPv6 headers. To make them more like vanilla IPv6 addresses, they are expected to be routable at an overlay level. Consequently, while they are considered non-routable addresses from the IPv6 layer point-of-view, all existing IPv6 applications are expected to be able to use them in a manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses. This document requests IANA to allocate a temporary prefix out of the IPv6 addressing space for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers. By default, the prefix will be returned to IANA in 2014, with continued use requiring IETF consensus. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community."];

Using the Host Identity Protocol with
Legacy Applications
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5338.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document is an informative overview of how legacy applications can be made to work with the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  HIP proposes to add a cryptographic name space for network stack names.  From an application viewpoint, HIP-enabled systems support a new address family of host identifiers, but it may be a long time until such HIP-aware applications are widely deployed even if host systems are upgraded.  This informational document discusses implementation and Application Programming Interface (API) issues relating to using HIP in situations in which the system is HIP-aware but the applications are not, and is intended to aid implementors and early adopters in thinking about and locally solving systems issues regarding the incremental deployment of HIP.

Basic Socket Interface Extensions for
IPv6
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3493.html", target="_top", tooltip="The de facto standard Application Program Interface (API) for TCP/IP applications is the sockets interface.  Although this API was developed for Unix in the early 1980s it has also been implemented on a wide variety of non-Unix systems.  TCP/IP applications written using the sockets API have in the past enjoyed a high degree of portability and we would like the same portability with IPv6 applications.  But changes are required to the sockets API to support IPv6 and this memo describes these changes.  These include a new socket address structure to carry IPv6 addresses, new address conversion functions, and some new socket options.  These extensions are designed to provide access to the basic IPv6 features required by TCP and UDP applications, including multicasting, while introducing a minimum of change into the system and providing complete compatibility for existing IPv4 applications.  Additional extensions for advanced IPv6 features (raw sockets and access to the IPv6 extension headers) are defined in another document.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Host Identity Protocol
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5201.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes.  HIP is based on a Sigma-compliant Diffie- Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.  The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the- middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional encryption for upper- layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.

IPv6 Socket API for Source Address
Selection

However, no such socket API exists in the basic (RFC 3493) or advanced (RFC 3542) IPv6 socket API documents.  This document fills that gap partially by specifying new socket-level options for source address selection and flags for the getaddrinfo() API to specify address selection based on the source address preference in accordance with the socket-level options that modify the default source address selection algorithm.  The socket API described in this document will be particularly useful for IPv6 applications that want to choose between temporary and public addresses, and for Mobile IPv6 aware applications that want to use the care-of address for communication.  It also specifies socket options and flags for selecting Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) or non-CGA source addresses.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
