Low-Latency Handoffs in Mobile IPv4
2007", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Mobile IPv4 describes how a Mobile Node can perform IPv4-layer handoffs between subnets served by different Foreign Agents.  In certain cases, the latency involved in these handoffs can be above the threshold required for the support of delay-sensitive or real-time services.  The aim of this document is to present two methods to achieve low-latency Mobile IPv4 handoffs.  In addition, a combination of these two methods is described.  The described techniques allow greater support for real-time services on a Mobile IPv4 network by minimizing the period of time when a Mobile Node is unable to send or receive IPv4 packets due to the delay in the Mobile IPv4 Registration process.

Link-Layer Event Notifications for

A Framework of Media-Independent Pre-
Authentication (MPA) for Inter-Domain
Handover Optimization
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6252.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes Media-independent Pre-Authentication (MPA), a new handover optimization mechanism that addresses the issues on existing mobility management protocols and mobility optimization mechanisms to support inter-domain handover. MPA is a mobile- assisted, secure handover optimization scheme that works over any link layer and with any mobility management protocol, and is most applicable to supporting optimization during inter-domain handover. MPA's pre-authentication, pre-configuration, and proactive handover techniques allow many of the handoff-related operations to take place before the mobile node has moved to the new network. We describe the details of all the associated techniques and their applicability for different scenarios involving various mobility protocols during inter-domain handover. We have implemented the MPA mechanism for various network-layer and application-layer mobility protocols, and we report a summary of experimental performance results in this document. This document is a product of the IP Mobility Optimizations (MOBOPTS) Research Group. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes."];
