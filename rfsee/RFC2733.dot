RTP Payload Format for Generic Forward
Error Correction
2007", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5109.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a payload format for generic Forward Error Correction (FEC) for media data encapsulated in RTP.  It is based on the exclusive-or (parity) operation.  The payload format described in this document allows end systems to apply protection using various protection lengths and levels, in addition to using various protection group sizes to adapt to different media and channel characteristics.  It enables complete recovery of the protected packets or partial recovery of the critical parts of the payload depending on the packet loss situation.  This scheme is completely compatible with non-FEC-capable hosts, so the receivers in a multicast group that do not implement FEC can still work by simply ignoring the protection data.  This specification obsoletes RFC 2733 and RFC 3009.  The FEC specified in this document is not backward compatible with RFC 2733 and RFC 3009. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

RTP Payload Format for 1-D Interleaved

The 1-D interleaved parity code is a systematic code, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent in a repair flow separate from the source flow that carries the source symbols.  The 1-D interleaved parity code offers a good protection against bursty packet losses at a cost of reasonable complexity.  The new payload format defined in this document should only be used (with some exceptions) as a part of the Digital Video Broadcasting-IPTV (DVB- IPTV) Application-layer FEC specification.

RTP Payload Format for Flexible Forward
Error Correction (FEC)
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8627.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error Correction (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes from source media encapsulated in RTP.  These parity codes are systematic codes (Flexible FEC, or FLEX FEC), where a number of FEC repair packets are generated from a set of source packets from one or more source RTP streams.  These FEC repair packets are sent in a redundancy RTP stream separate from the source RTP stream(s) that carries the source packets.  RTP source packets that were lost in transmission can be reconstructed using the source and repair packets that were received.  The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes that are defined in this specification offer a good protection against random and bursty packet losses, respectively, at a cost of complexity.  The RTP payload formats that are defined in this document address scalability issues experienced with the earlier specifications and offer several improvements.  Due to these changes, the new payload formats are not backward compatible with earlier specifications; however, endpoints that do not implement this specification can still work by simply ignoring the FEC repair packets."];
