Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult.

This document proposes experimental extensions to TLS with opaque pinning tickets as a way to pin the server's identity. During an initial TLS session, the server provides an original encrypted pinning ticket. In subsequent TLS session establishment, upon receipt of the pinning ticket, the server proves its ability to decrypt the pinning ticket and thus the ownership of the pinning protection key.

Environment (ACME) Profile for
Generating Delegated Certificates
2021", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9115.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines a profile of the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol by which the holder of an identifier (e.g., a domain name) can allow a third party to obtain an X.509 certificate such that the certificate subject is the delegated identifier while the certified public key corresponds to a private key controlled by the third party.  A primary use case is that of a Content Delivery Network (CDN), the third party, terminating TLS sessions on behalf of a content provider (the holder of a domain name).  The presented mechanism allows the holder of the identifier to retain control over the delegation and revoke it at any time.  Importantly, this mechanism does not require any modification to the deployed TLS clients and servers."];

Delay-Tolerant Networking TCP
Convergence-Layer Protocol Version 4
2022", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9174.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes a TCP convergence layer (TCPCL) for Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN).  This version of the TCPCL protocol resolves implementation issues in the earlier TCPCL version 3 as defined in RFC 7242 and provides updates to the Bundle Protocol (BP) contents, encodings, and convergence-layer requirements in BP version 7 (BPv7).  Specifically, TCPCLv4 uses BPv7 bundles encoded by the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) as its service data unit being transported and provides a reliable transport of such bundles.  This TCPCL version also includes security and extensibility mechanisms."];

Delegated Credentials for TLS and DTLS

For example, the lifetime of certificates, how they may be used, and the algorithms they support are ultimately determined by the Certification Authority (CA).  This document describes a mechanism to overcome some of these limitations by enabling operators to delegate their own credentials for use in TLS and DTLS without breaking compatibility with peers that do not support this specification."];

Simple Provisioning of Public Names for

Home networks are increasingly numbered using IPv6 addresses, which in principle makes this access simpler, but accessing home networks from the Internet requires the names and IP addresses of these devices and services to be made available in the public DNS. This document describes how a Home Naming Authority (NHA) instructs the outsourced infrastructure to publish these pieces of information in the public DNS. The names and IP addresses of the home network are set in the Public Homenet Zone by the Homenet Naming Authority (HNA), which in turn instructs an outsourced infrastructure to publish the zone on behalf of the home network owner."];

The Certification Authority (CA) that issues these short-lived certificates do not publish revocation information because the certificate lifespan that is shorter than the time needed to detect, report, and distribute revocation information.  Some long-lived X.509v3 public key certificates never expire, and they are never revoked.  This specification defines the noRevAvail certificate extension so that a relying party can readily determine that the CA does not publish revocation information for the certificate, and it updates the certification path validation algorithm defined in RFC 5280 so that revocation checking is skipped when the noRevAvail certificate extension is present."];
