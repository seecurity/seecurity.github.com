Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET)

Enterprise network nodes require a means to automatically provision IP addresses/prefixes and support internetworking operation in a wide variety of use cases including Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) networks, Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), multi-organizational corporate networks and the interdomain core of the global Internet itself.

Routing and Addressing in Networks with
Global Enterprise Recursion (RANGER)
2010", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5720.html", target="_top", tooltip="RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing in networks with global enterprise recursion.  The term enterprise network within this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and deployment scenarios, where an enterprise can be as small as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) network, as dynamic as a Mobile Ad Hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational corporation, or as large as the global Internet itself.  Such networks will require an architected solution for the coordination of routing and addressing plans with accommodations for scalability, provider-independence, mobility, multihoming, and security.  These considerations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the same principles apply even for clean-slate approaches.  The RANGER architecture addresses these requirements and provides a comprehensive framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence.

Analysis of Inter-Domain Routing
Requirements and History

The analysis is carried out with respect to RFC 1126 and other IDR requirements and design efforts looking at the routing system as it appeared to be in 2001 with editorial additions reflecting developments up to 2006.  It is the companion document to A Set of Possible Requirements for a Future Routing Architecture (RFC 5772), which is a discussion of requirements for the future routing architecture, addressing systems developments and future routing protocols.  This document summarizes discussions held several years ago by members of the IRTF Routing Research Group (IRTF RRG) and other interested parties.  The document is published with the support of the IRTF RRG as a record of the work completed at that time, but with the understanding that it does not necessarily represent either the latest technical understanding or the technical consensus of the research group at the date of publication.  This document defines a Historic Document for the Internet community."];
