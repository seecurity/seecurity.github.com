This document specifies some updates in RFC 4348 to enable support for the new operating mode of VMR-WB standard (i.e., VMR-WB mode 4). These updates do not affect the existing modes of VMR-WB already specified in RFC 4348. The payload formats and their associated parameters, as well as all provisions, restrictions, use cases, features, etc., that are specified in RFC 4348 are applicable to the new operating mode with no exception.

Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)
Payload Format for the Variable-Rate
Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) Audio Codec
2006", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC4348.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies a real-time transport protocol (RTP) payload format to be used for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) speech codec. The payload format is designed to be able to interoperate with existing VMR-WB transport formats on non-IP networks. A media type registration is included for VMR-WB RTP payload format. VMR-WB is a variable-rate multimode wideband speech codec that has a number of operating modes, one of which is interoperable with AMR-WB (i.e., RFC 3267) audio codec at certain rates. Therefore, provisions have been made in this document to facilitate and simplify data packet exchange between VMR-WB and AMR-WB in the interoperable mode with no transcoding function involved.
