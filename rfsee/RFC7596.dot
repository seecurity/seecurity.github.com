Lightweight 4over6: An Extension to the

This removes the requirement for a Carrier Grade NAT function in the tunnel concentrator and reduces the amount of centralized state that must be held to a per-subscriber level.

Public 4over6 was developed in the IETF and is in use in some existing deployments but is not recommended for new deployments.  Future deployments of similar scenarios should use Lightweight 4over6.  Public 4over6 follows the Hub and Spoke softwire model and uses an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to forward IPv4 packets over an IPv6 access network.  The bidirectionality of the IPv4 communication is achieved by explicitly allocating global non-shared IPv4 addresses to end users and by maintaining IPv4-IPv6 address binding on the border relay.

The Address plus Port (A+P) Approach to
the IPv4 Address Shortage
2011", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC6346.html", target="_top", tooltip="We are facing the exhaustion of the IANA IPv4 free IP address pool. Unfortunately, IPv6 is not yet deployed widely enough to fully replace IPv4, and it is unrealistic to expect that this is going to change before the depletion of IPv4 addresses. Letting hosts seamlessly communicate in an IPv4 world without assigning a unique globally routable IPv4 address to each of them is a challenging problem. This document proposes an IPv4 address sharing scheme, treating some of the port number bits as part of an extended IPv4 address (Address plus Port, or A+P). Instead of assigning a single IPv4 address to a single customer device, we propose to extend the address field by using bits from the port number range in the TCP/UDP header as additional endpoint identifiers, thus leaving a reduced range of ports available to applications. This means assigning the same IPv4 address to multiple clients (e.g., Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), mobile phones), each with its assigned port range. In the face of IPv4 address exhaustion, the need for addresses is stronger than the need to be able to address thousands of applications on a single host. If address translation is needed, the end-user should be in control of the translation process -- not some smart boxes in the core.

For DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) to function with some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mechanisms and deployment scenarios (e.g., RFC 7596 or RFC 7597), the operator needs to know the IPv6 address that the client will use as the source of an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire tunnel.
