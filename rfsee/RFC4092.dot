Usage of the Session Description

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes how to use the Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) semantics of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) grouping framework in SIP.  In particular, we define the sdp-anat SIP option-tag.  This SIP option-tag ensures that SDP session descriptions that use ANAT are only handled by SIP entities with ANAT support.  To justify the need for such a SIP option-tag, we describe what could possibly happen if an ANAT-unaware SIP entity tried to handle media lines grouped with ANAT. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Alternate Connectivity (ALTC) Attribute

The proposed attribute, the altc attribute, solves the backward-compatibility problem that plagued Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) due to their syntax. The proposed solution is applicable to scenarios where connectivity checks are not required. If connectivity checks are required, Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), as specified in RFC 5245, provides such a solution."];
