While Quick-Start is designed to be used by a range of transport protocols, in this document we only specify its use with TCP. Quick-Start is designed to allow connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers along the path approve the Quick-Start Request. This document describes many paths where Quick-Start Requests would not be approved. These paths include all paths containing routers, IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start. These paths also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing IP options. Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that include multi-access layer- two networks. This document also describes environments where the Quick-Start process could fail with false positives, with the sender incorrectly assuming that the Quick-Start Request had been approved by all of the routers along the path. As a result of these concerns, and as a result of the difficulties and seeming absence of motivation for routers, such as core routers to deploy Quick-Start, Quick-Start is being proposed as a mechanism that could be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet.

In addition, IAX uses a single UDP data stream on a static port greatly simplifying Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway traversal, eliminating the need for other protocols to work around NAT, and simplifying network and firewall management.

TCP-AO is compatible with either a static Master Key Tuple (MKT) configuration or an external, out-of-band MKT management mechanism; in either case, TCP-AO also protects connections when using the same MKT across repeated instances of a connection, using traffic keys derived from the MKT, and coordinates MKT changes between endpoints.  The result is intended to support current infrastructure uses of TCP MD5, such as to protect long-lived connections (as used, e.g., in BGP and LDP), and to support a larger set of MACs with minimal other system and operational changes.  TCP-AO uses a different option identifier than TCP MD5, even though TCP-AO and TCP MD5 are never permitted to be used simultaneously.

This document describes a number of simple and efficient methods for the selection of the client port number, such that the possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced.  While this is not a replacement for cryptographic methods for protecting the transport-protocol instance, the aforementioned port selection algorithms provide improved security with very little effort and without any key management overhead.

The Content-Digest field can be used for the integrity of HTTP message content. The Repr-Digest field can be used for the integrity of HTTP representations. Want-Content-Digest and Want-Repr-Digest can be used to indicate a sender's interest and preferences for receiving the respective Integrity fields.

Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUIDs)
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9562.html", target="_top", tooltip="This specification defines UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifiers) --
also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifiers) -- and a Uniform
Resource Name namespace for UUIDs. A UUID is 128 bits long and is
intended to guarantee uniqueness across space and time. UUIDs were
originally used in the Apollo Network Computing System (NCS), later
in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF's) Distributed Computing
Environment (DCE), and then in Microsoft Windows platforms. This specification is derived from the OSF DCE specification with the
kind permission of the OSF (now known as The Open Group). Information from earlier versions of the OSF DCE specification have
been incorporated into this document. This document obsoletes RFC
4122."];

OpenPGP
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9580.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document specifies the message formats used in OpenPGP. OpenPGP provides encryption with public key or symmetric cryptographic algorithms, digital signatures, compression, and key management. This document is maintained in order to publish all necessary information needed to develop interoperable applications based on the OpenPGP format. It is not a step-by-step cookbook for writing an application. It describes only the format and methods needed to read, check, generate, and write conforming packets crossing any network. It does not deal with storage and implementation questions. It does, however, discuss implementation issues necessary to avoid security flaws. This document obsoletes RFCs 4880 (OpenPGP Message Format), 5581 (The Camellia Cipher in OpenPGP), and 6637 (Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in OpenPGP)."];

Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)
2024", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9639.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document defines the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) format and its streamable subset.  FLAC is designed to reduce the amount of computer storage space needed to store digital audio signals.  It does this losslessly, i.e., it does so without losing information.  FLAC is free in the sense that its specification is open and its reference implementation is open source.  Compared to other lossless audio coding formats, FLAC is a format with low complexity and can be encoded and decoded with little computing resources.  Decoding of FLAC has been implemented independently for many different platforms, and both encoding and decoding can be implemented without needing floating-point arithmetic."];

Specifically, this document provides updates to fix shortcomings in the description of some Information Elements (IEs), to ensure a consistent structure when citing an existing IANA registry, and to fix broken pointers, orphaned section references, etc.  The updates are also meant to bring some consistency among the entries of the registry."];

These extensions permit the negotiation of an application protocol variant of RADIUS called RADIUS/1.1. No changes are made to RADIUS/UDP or RADIUS/TCP. The extensions allow the negotiation of a transport profile where the RADIUS shared secret is no longer used, and all MD5-based packet authentication and attribute obfuscation methods are removed.
