M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in

This document describes how to run, within a single IS-IS domain, a set of independent IP topologies that we call Multi-Topologies (MTs).  This MT extension can be used for a variety of purposes, such as an in-band management network on top of the original IGP topology, maintaining separate IGP routing domains for isolated multicast or IPv6 islands within the backbone, or forcing a subset of an address space to follow a different topology.

The Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
Join Attribute Format
2008", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC5384.html", target="_top", tooltip="A Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode Join message sent by a given node identifies one or more multicast distribution trees that that node wishes to join.  Each tree is identified by the combination of a multicast group address and a source address (where the source address is possibly a wild card).  Under certain conditions it can be useful, when joining a tree, to specify additional information related to the construction of the tree.  However, there has been no way to do so until now.  This document describes a modification of the Join message that allows a node to associate attributes with a particular tree.  The attributes are encoded in Type-Length-Value format.

LDP Extensions to Support Maximally

A prime use of MRTs is for unicast and multicast IP/LDP Fast Reroute, which we will refer to as MRT-FRR. The sole protocol extension to LDP is simply the ability to advertise an MRT Capability. This document describes that extension and the associated behavior expected for Label Switching Routers (LSRs) and Label Edge Routers (LERs) advertising the MRT Capability. MRT-FRR uses LDP multi-topology extensions, so three multi-topology IDs have been allocated from the MPLS MT-ID space."];
