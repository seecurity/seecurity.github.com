Generic Security Service Application
Program Interface (GSS-API)
Internationalization and Domain-Based
Service Names and Name Type
2008", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="This document describes domain-name-based service principal names and the corresponding name type for the Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API). Internationalization of the GSS-API is also covered. Domain-based service names are similar to host-based service names, but using a domain name (not necessarily an Internet domain name) in addition to a hostname. The primary purpose of domain-based names is to provide a measure of protection to applications that utilize insecure service discovery protocols. This is achieved by providing a way to name clustered services after the domain which they service, thereby allowing their clients to authorize the service's servers based on authentication of their service names.

This backward-compatible representation is required in existing protocols like DNS, so that IDNs can be introduced with no changes to the existing infrastructure.
