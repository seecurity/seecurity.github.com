This investigation only targeted the protocols as documented in the Request For Comments Series (RFCs).  This investigation discovered little reason for concern with regards to the functionality of the protocols.  A few minor cases of older implementations still using two digit years (ala RFC 850) were discovered, but almost all Internet protocols were given a clean bill of health.  Several cases of period problems were discovered, where a time field would roll over as the size of field was reached.  In particular, there are several protocols, which have 32 bit, signed integer representations of the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 which will turn negative at Tue Jan 19 03:14:07 GMT 2038.  Areas whose protocols will be effected by such problems have been notified so that new revisions will remove this limitation.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];

Generic YANG Data Model for the

Protocols That Use Connectionless
Communications
2019", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8532.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document presents a base YANG Data model for the management of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols that use connectionless communications.

It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for OAM protocols that use connectionless communication. The base model presented here can be extended to include technology-specific details. There are two key benefits of this approach: First, it leads to uniformity between OAM protocols. Second, it supports both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at the same level or different levels through a unified interface) as well as interactive OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at the same level through a unified interface)."];
