Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult. This document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for generating such quantities.

For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication.  ZRTP can utilize a Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication through the signaling channel.

BGPsec Design Choices and Summary of
Supporting Discussions
2018", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC8374.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document captures the design rationale of the initial draft version of what became RFC 8205 (the BGPsec protocol specification).  The designers needed to balance many competing factors, and this document lists the decisions that were made in favor of or against each design choice.  This document also presents brief summaries of the arguments that aided the decision process.  Where appropriate, this document also provides brief notes on design decisions that changed as the specification was reviewed and updated by the IETF SIDR Working Group and that resulted in RFC 8205.  These notes highlight the differences and provide pointers to details and rationale regarding those design changes."];
