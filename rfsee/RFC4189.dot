Requirements for End-to-Middle Security
for the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP)
2005", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA) does not always trust all intermediaries in its request path to inspect its message bodies and/or headers contained in its message.  The UA might want to protect the message bodies and/or headers from intermediaries, except those that provide services based on its content.  This situation requires a mechanism called end-to-middle security to secure the information passed between the UA and intermediaries, which does not interfere with end-to-end security.  This document defines a set of requirements for a mechanism to achieve end-to-middle security.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.", style=filled, fillcolor=green];
