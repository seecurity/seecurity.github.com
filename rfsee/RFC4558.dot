Node-ID Based Resource Reservation
Protocol (RSVP) Hello: A Clarification
Statement
2006", shape=ellipse, fillcolor="#e8f0ff", tooltip="Use of Node-ID based Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Hello messages is implied in a number of cases, e.g., when data and control planes are separated, when TE links are unnumbered.  Furthermore, when link level failure detection is performed by some means other than exchanging RSVP Hello messages, use of a Node-ID based Hello session is optimal for detecting signaling adjacency failure for Resource reSerVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE).  Nonetheless, this implied behavior is unclear, and this document formalizes use of the Node-ID based RSVP Hello session in some scenarios.  The procedure described in this document applies to both Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) capable nodes.

RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP
Tunnels
2001", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3209.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document describes the use of RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol), including all the necessary extensions, to establish label-switched paths (LSPs) in MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching).  Since the flow along an LSP is completely identified by the label applied at the ingress node of the path, these paths may be treated as tunnels.  A key application of LSP tunnels is traffic engineering with MPLS as specified in RFC 2702. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Gap Analysis for Operating IPv6-Only
MPLS Networks
2015", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC7439.html", target="_top", tooltip="This document reviews the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocol suite in the context of IPv6 and identifies gaps that must be addressed in order to allow MPLS-related protocols and applications to be used with IPv6-only networks. This document is intended to focus on gaps in the standards defining the MPLS suite, and is not intended to highlight particular vendor implementations (or lack thereof) in the context of IPv6-only MPLS functionality. In the data plane, MPLS fully supports IPv6, and MPLS labeled packets can be carried over IPv6 packets in a variety of encapsulations. However, support for IPv6 among MPLS control-plane protocols, MPLS applications, MPLS Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), and MIB modules is mixed, with some protocols having major gaps. For most major gaps, work is in progress to upgrade the relevant protocols."];

Refresh-Interval Independent RSVP Fast
Reroute Facility Protection
2025", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC9705.html", target="_top", tooltip="The RSVP-TE Fast Reroute (FRR) extensions specified in RFC 4090 define two local repair techniques to reroute Label Switched Path (LSP) traffic over pre-established backup tunnels.  Facility backup method allows one or more LSPs traversing a connected link or node to be protected using a bypass tunnel.  The many-to-one nature of local repair technique is attractive from a scalability point of view.  This document enumerates facility backup procedures in RFC 4090 that rely on refresh timeout, hence, making facility backup method refresh-interval dependent.  The RSVP-TE extensions defined in this document will enhance the facility backup protection mechanism by making the corresponding procedures refresh-interval independent, and hence, compatible with the Refresh-Interval Independent RSVP (RI-RSVP) capability specified in RFC 8370.  Hence, this document updates RFC 4090 in order to support the RI-RSVP capability specified in RFC 8370."];
