An Extensible Message Format for
Delivery Status Notifications
2003", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3464.html", target="_top", tooltip="This memo defines a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) content-type that may be used by a message transfer agent (MTA) or electronic mail gateway to report the result of an attempt to deliver a message to one or more recipients.  This content-type is intended as a machine-processable replacement for the various types of delivery status notifications currently used in Internet electronic mail.  Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the so-called Local Area Network (LAN)-based systems), the Delivery Status Notification (DSN) protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of foreign addresses and error codes, in addition to those normally used in Internet mail.  Additional attributes may also be defined to support tunneling of foreign notifications through Internet mail. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];

Message Disposition Notification

This content-type is intended to be machine-processable.  Additional message headers are also defined to permit Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender of a message.  The purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary LAN-based systems, and often referred to as read receipts, acknowledgements, or receipt notifications. The intention is to do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past.  Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary LAN-based systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment.

The original Sieve reject action defined in RFC 3028 required use of MDNs for rejecting messages, thus contributing to the flood of Joe-job spam to victims of Joe-jobs. This memo updates the definition of the reject action to allow messages to be refused during the SMTP transaction, and defines the ereject action to require messages to be refused during the SMTP transaction, if possible. The ereject action is intended to replace the reject action wherever possible. The ereject action is similar to reject, but will always favor protocol-level message rejection. [STANDARDS-TRACK]"];
