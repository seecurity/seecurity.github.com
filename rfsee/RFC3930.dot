The Protocol versus Document Points of
View in Computer Protocols

Although each point of view has a place, adherence to a document point of view can be damaging to protocol design.  By understanding both points of view, conflicts between them may be clarified and reduced.

Exclusive XML Canonicalization, Version

2004", shape=ellipse, URL="RFC3741.html", target="_top", tooltip="Canonical XML specifies a standard serialization of XML that, when applied to a subdocument, includes the subdocument's ancestor context including all of the namespace declarations and attributes in the xml: namespace.  However, some applications require a method which, to the extent practical, excludes ancestor context from a canonicalized subdocument.  For example, one might require a digital signature over an XML payload (subdocument) in an XML message that will not break when that subdocument is removed from its original message and/or inserted into a different context.  This requirement is satisfied by Exclusive XML Canonicalization.  This memo provides information for the Internet community."];
